#Obligatory Dotfile Repo
###
Nothing super crazy going on here, but some sensable vim and tmux configs.

##Note to iterm
I use solarized for my color scheme, but iterm is wonky with it.
Rule of thumb is to set your terminal emulation to `xterm-256`

I believe OSX's terminal app should be okay, but will make note of that.

##Powerline
I have my [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) path in here because it's super powerful and fun.
Check it out and see if this is for you. If not, just delete the lines in the `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf`.

##TODO
Make install file for my own personal setup.
 - maybe a rakefile or a `.sh` file, whatevers easier.

Add bash profile, aliases, and functions.
 - some sensable additions to make life easier (and more colorful)

Check for dependencies.
 - I use macvim in my system terminal for python bindings, and homebrew to manage things like git, node, python, etc
 - [Maximum Awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome) and [Paul's Dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) do this well.
