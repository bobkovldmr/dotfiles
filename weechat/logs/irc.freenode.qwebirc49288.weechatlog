2014-12-08 11:12:21	qwebirc49288	Hi, there?
2014-12-08 11:13:00	qwebirc49288	I got this error. TypeError: Cannot read property ‘toast’ of undefined
2014-12-08 11:13:12	qwebirc49288	using ngCordova.plugin.toast
2014-12-08 11:14:21	mhartington	well could be a few things
2014-12-08 11:14:37	mhartington	are you injecting it into your controller?
2014-12-08 11:15:10	mhartington	also, is ng-cordova loaded before cordova.js in your index.html
2014-12-08 11:17:09	qwebirc49288	yes
2014-12-08 11:17:13	qwebirc49288	for all that
2014-12-08 11:17:33	qwebirc49288	angular.module('app', ['ionic', 'ngCordova'])
2014-12-08 11:17:42	mhartington	can you put together a pastebin of your controller?
2014-12-08 11:18:17	qwebirc49288	.controller('TestCtrl', function($scope, $state, $location, $cordovaToast){ 	$cordovaToast     .show('Here is a message', 'long', 'center')     .then(function(success) {       // success     }, function (error) {       // error     });})
2014-12-08 11:18:40	qwebirc49288	thats the test i was doing to see if it was working
2014-12-08 11:18:47	mhartington	please don't paste code into irc
2014-12-08 11:18:52	mhartington	use pastbin
2014-12-08 11:18:57	mhartington	pastebin*
2014-12-08 11:19:07	qwebirc49288	sry
2014-12-08 11:19:22	mhartington	my irc client is in my terminal so it can't handle code
2014-12-08 11:20:18	qwebirc49288	http://pastebin.com/gFBVF7Km
2014-12-08 11:22:07	mhartington	you installed the native plugin right?
2014-12-08 11:23:07	qwebirc49288	like this
2014-12-08 11:23:08	qwebirc49288	cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
2014-12-08 11:24:12	mhartington	anything else? did you add anything to the config.xml or reference a js file?
2014-12-08 11:24:30	qwebirc49288	<script src="js/ng-cordova.js"></script>
2014-12-08 11:24:34	qwebirc49288	in index.html
2014-12-08 11:24:49	mhartington	pastebin your index.html?
2014-12-08 11:25:26	qwebirc49288	http://pastebin.com/ngQagMKc
2014-12-08 11:30:27	mhartington	Hmm, not sure what could be causing the issue
2014-12-08 11:30:38	mhartington	is your version of ngCordova old?
2014-12-08 11:30:47	mhartington	maybe it jsut doesn't have the toast plugin
