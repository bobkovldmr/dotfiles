2014-12-10 14:14:52	mhartington	got it, thanks 
2014-12-10 14:14:56	mhartington	any plugins I should install?
2014-12-10 14:15:25	ioudas	this one does not have view-title in it. code wise.. ill tackle the back buttons first. but basically its like the back button when visible displays the text of the previous view... need to disable that entirely.....
2014-12-10 14:15:42	ioudas	then back buttons dont exist in somve views.. .cant even navigate anymore to some views..... no matter how i define them
2014-12-10 14:15:51	ioudas	nah, this is just a basic app.. with a cobol back end.
2014-12-10 14:16:04	mhartington	cool, as for the back butotn, I have to ask
2014-12-10 14:16:07	ioudas	If you want i can put up a front facing data side to this.
2014-12-10 14:16:09	mhartington	did you update the css to?
2014-12-10 14:16:12	ioudas	yes
2014-12-10 14:16:17	mhartington	alright, hah
2014-12-10 14:16:29	mhartington	some people have said the same thing and forgot the css
2014-12-10 14:16:32	ioudas	871 is much better than the last 4 or 5 nightlys. tabs broke.. everything broke.
2014-12-10 14:16:33	mhartington	so I had to ask
2014-12-10 14:16:51	ioudas	Yeah i copied it over... but feel free to check if im an idiot anywhere
2014-12-10 14:17:04	ioudas	what gets me is i cant even define a back button anymore... or even use $state.go
2014-12-10 14:17:59	mhartington	well I can use state.go here
2014-12-10 14:17:59	mhartington	http://codepen.io/mhartington/pen/ByjXgG
2014-12-10 14:18:08	mhartington	just as a heads up
2014-12-10 14:18:16	mhartington	so I don't think its broken
2014-12-10 14:18:21	mhartington	just confused maybe
2014-12-10 14:23:11	mhartington	where can I find the user name and password?
2014-12-10 14:24:16	ioudas	oh its def broken, i follow that code.
2014-12-10 14:24:18	ioudas	and it doesnt work
2014-12-10 14:24:26	ioudas	the existing code works in beta 13 flawlessly
2014-12-10 14:24:33	ioudas	without issue
2014-12-10 14:24:40	ioudas	now i cant even navigate states
2014-12-10 14:24:57	ioudas	its gonna be hard for you to see the app in action, as the login is a soap call to a cobol interface
2014-12-10 14:25:00	ioudas	which is on a lan
2014-12-10 14:25:05	ioudas	at the moment
2014-12-10 14:25:20	ioudas	i mean literally not a single $state.go works past the inital search anymore.....
2014-12-10 14:26:26	ioudas	i can screenshot for you.... but until we get the public interface up.. id have to put all the data calls as json, rewrite the login api...
2014-12-10 14:26:28	ioudas	searching...
2014-12-10 14:27:53	ioudas	i can make a video or images of whats goin on... tho
2014-12-10 14:28:04	mhartington	video is better than nothing
2014-12-10 14:44:26	ioudas	im almost there giving you a prod interface
2014-12-10 14:44:28	ioudas	right now
2014-12-10 14:44:29	ioudas	with login
2014-12-10 14:44:38	ioudas	gimme a little
2014-12-10 14:44:59	mhartington	alright, no worries
2014-12-10 15:49:32	ioudas	bah having problems with the public interface
2014-12-10 16:18:58	mhartington	going to be loggin off IRC for a bit
2014-12-10 16:19:22	mhartington	if you end up getting this to work, feel free to shoot me an email I can take look
2014-12-11 10:14:38	mhartington	Hey Greg!
2014-12-11 10:25:01	mhartington	so I got the login info for your app
2014-12-11 10:25:11	mhartington	when I went to sign in and search I saw this error
2014-12-11 10:25:15	mhartington	at the search page 
2014-12-11 10:25:16	mhartington	http://pastebin.com/2EtYRdGx
2014-12-11 10:43:42	ioudas	hmmm
2014-12-11 10:43:45	ioudas	interesting
2014-12-11 10:44:09	ioudas	its cause you dont have a token
2014-12-11 10:44:12	ioudas	can you try relogging in
2014-12-11 10:44:34	ioudas	lemme try to recreate
2014-12-11 10:45:40	mhartington	also, we've updated the ui-router to 0.2.13, which is the latest version
2014-12-11 10:45:54	ioudas	yeah, i think thats my problem
2014-12-11 10:46:04	ioudas	I think i fixed the back button text as well.... disabled that
2014-12-11 10:46:17	ioudas	i dont understand how its changed, from the previous version...
2014-12-11 10:46:27	mhartington	the back button text?
2014-12-11 10:46:37	mhartington	or the nav-bar in general?
2014-12-11 10:47:21	ioudas	yeah, there was now the previos view's title beside the back button.
2014-12-11 10:47:25	ioudas	in the new view.
2014-12-11 10:47:34	mhartington	yes
2014-12-11 10:47:36	ioudas	somehow i got rid of it.. but i was up at midnight and cant remember it
2014-12-11 10:47:41	ioudas	i wasnt sure, but i need to disable it for all
2014-12-11 10:47:47	ioudas	but the real problem is i cant navigate states
2014-12-11 10:47:47	mhartington	well this is all configurable stuff
2014-12-11 10:47:50	ioudas	yeah
2014-12-11 10:47:59	ioudas	we are commenting out the unique token code 
2014-12-11 10:48:01	ioudas	so you should be good
2014-12-11 10:48:07	ioudas	but i relogged in, got a token and can search
2014-12-11 10:48:11	ioudas	try a search of "blue"
2014-12-11 10:48:14	ioudas	in the search field
2014-12-11 10:48:18	ioudas	and try restarting the app
2014-12-11 10:48:22	ioudas	worked from my remote desktop
2014-12-11 10:49:05	mhartington	http://ionicframework.com/docs/nightly/api/provider/$ionicConfigProvider/
2014-12-11 10:49:09	mhartington	for the nav bar stuff
2014-12-11 10:49:16	mhartington	also, got this error now 
2014-12-11 10:49:17	mhartington	TypeError: Cannot read property 'FoundRecordsItems' of undefined
2014-12-11 10:49:25	ioudas	weird
2014-12-11 10:49:35	ioudas	I dont get it
2014-12-11 10:49:41	ioudas	its like you arent getting search results
2014-12-11 10:49:50	ioudas	give me 2 mins for the cobol guy to drop the token checking
2014-12-11 10:49:59	mhartington	sure thing
2014-12-11 10:55:53	ioudas	Ok try it now. 
2014-12-11 10:55:55	ioudas	log in
2014-12-11 10:55:59	ioudas	product search
2014-12-11 10:56:05	ioudas	type BLUE (wait a while) 
2014-12-11 10:56:07	ioudas	then it should work
2014-12-11 10:56:23	ioudas	token code is remvoed
2014-12-11 10:56:25	ioudas	and works for me
2014-12-11 10:56:29	mhartington	working for m
2014-12-11 10:56:32	mhartington	me*
2014-12-11 10:56:45	ioudas	cool
2014-12-11 10:57:21	ioudas	the cancelling doesnt work atm. but once you get results... you pop open the accordion
2014-12-11 10:57:28	ioudas	the only state that works since upgrade is the stock check
2014-12-11 10:57:34	mhartington	yup, I'm there
2014-12-11 10:57:37	ioudas	price check just issues $state.go
2014-12-11 10:57:46	ioudas	and dies out
2014-12-11 10:57:54	ioudas	back goes back to the origonal product search...
2014-12-11 10:57:59	ioudas	instead of the results
2014-12-11 10:58:17	ioudas	the info of how the back buttons previously worked was in that email
2014-12-11 10:58:34	mhartington	okay, so price check doesn't work, but view stock does
2014-12-11 10:58:39	ioudas	yep
2014-12-11 10:58:45	ioudas	now youre at where i am at
2014-12-11 10:58:49	ioudas	all this works in beta 13
2014-12-11 10:58:56	ioudas	and the states, now dont work
2014-12-11 10:59:05	ioudas	and ive tried redoing them based on your code pen, but they all break...
2014-12-11 11:00:34	ioudas	and there is no back button from the results, to the search
2014-12-11 11:00:57	ioudas	regardless of how i try to change it. I think its all in the state provider. but i cant find documentation on how to fix it 
2014-12-11 11:01:02	ioudas	ill brb running to the bank
2014-12-11 11:02:52	mhartington	well I'm getting two back buttons from view stock
2014-12-11 11:03:14	mhartington	http://oi59.tinypic.com/11jsz06.jpg
2014-12-11 11:03:28	mhartington	one goes back to the results, and the other to the search page
2014-12-11 11:23:15	mhartington	okay, so the reason why the system back button won't go back to the search results
2014-12-11 11:23:34	mhartington	the search resulst should be part of the url
2014-12-11 12:03:51	ioudas	yeah the back button was a manual test
2014-12-11 12:03:59	ioudas	but the back button never used to go to that search tab
2014-12-11 12:04:02	ioudas	it use to go to the result tab
2014-12-11 12:04:12	ioudas	the routes and backs are completely changed.
2014-12-11 12:08:08	ioudas	and so have the back buttons
2014-12-11 13:33:52	mhartington	hey so good news!
2014-12-11 13:34:10	mhartington	well good news and bad news really
2014-12-11 13:34:15	ioudas	oh no
2014-12-11 13:34:21	mhartington	hah, well its not that bad
2014-12-11 13:34:26	mhartington	but I got state.go to work
2014-12-11 13:34:30	ioudas	Where
2014-12-11 13:34:44	mhartington	for both stock and price check
2014-12-11 13:34:49	ioudas	Id be interested in that
2014-12-11 13:35:15	mhartington	alright so the issue was coming from multiple places 
2014-12-11 13:35:25	ioudas	Sure
2014-12-11 13:35:43	mhartington	really the additional pages each with their own side-menu structure 
2014-12-11 13:35:53	ioudas	?
2014-12-11 13:36:03	ioudas	the only page with a side menu should be the result page?
2014-12-11 13:36:07	mhartington	but also they all had an ng-app attriubte too
2014-12-11 13:36:29	mhartington	price check and stock check both had them
2014-12-11 13:36:47	ioudas	side menus?
2014-12-11 13:36:50	ioudas	i dont see any
2014-12-11 13:36:57	ioudas	ah
2014-12-11 13:36:59	ioudas	shit
2014-12-11 13:37:02	ioudas	i see it now
2014-12-11 13:37:37	ioudas	yeah i dont really need side menus on either  of those
2014-12-11 13:37:41	ioudas	they do nothing
2014-12-11 13:39:01	mhartington	alright 
2014-12-11 13:39:33	ioudas	ill remove those
2014-12-11 13:39:41	ioudas	see if that helps
2014-12-11 13:39:50	mhartington	well thats one part too
2014-12-11 13:40:02	mhartington	so now lets look at your stateprovider.js
2014-12-11 13:40:05	ioudas	sure
2014-12-11 13:40:47	mhartington	so there are multiple cases where controller are declared in the wrong place
2014-12-11 13:41:10	mhartington	nested views need to have controlles afte the templateUrl
2014-12-11 13:41:33	ioudas	sure
2014-12-11 13:41:35	mhartington	there were a few where they were outside the views object
2014-12-11 13:42:06	mhartington	and two down the bottom that were missing quotes around the controllers
2014-12-11 13:42:26	ioudas	Could you send me your code changes? To ioudas@gmail?
2014-12-11 13:42:34	ioudas	do the back buttons work now?
2014-12-11 13:42:34	mhartington	sure thig
2014-12-11 13:42:44	mhartington	that I'm still working on
2014-12-11 13:42:48	ioudas	ah ok
2014-12-11 13:42:54	mhartington	but I wanted to fix navigation first 
2014-12-11 13:43:13	mhartington	pretty sure though that I know the issue
2014-12-11 13:43:22	ioudas	sure
2014-12-11 13:43:22	mhartington	so I'll fix that up and send you an email
2014-12-11 13:43:27	ioudas	sounds great
2014-12-11 13:43:30	ioudas	you guys are awesome
2014-12-12 10:42:30	mhartington	did you remove the tester account?
2014-12-12 10:42:42	ioudas	no, passwords change from day to day
2014-12-12 10:42:43	ioudas	let me reset
2014-12-12 10:42:48	ioudas	i can also give you my changed code base
2014-12-12 10:43:12	mhartington	yeah that would help
2014-12-12 10:43:28	mhartington	I wasn't seeing the slide box issues yesterday though
2014-12-12 10:43:39	mhartington	so it could be a regression in the nightly builds 
2014-12-12 10:43:42	ioudas	yeah, that one was weird, same with the nav button.
2014-12-12 10:43:55	ioudas	as the side menus you deleted from stock/result and such.
2014-12-12 10:44:17	ioudas	password should work now
2014-12-12 10:44:59	ioudas	let me send you my updated code base. It would be really nice to keep it in the side menu, but like I said, im fine with what ever. Just wasnt havin much luck with the pop over and the filter.
2014-12-12 10:45:25	mhartington	well thats not how the sidemenu works anymore
2014-12-12 10:45:33	ioudas	:-/
2014-12-12 10:45:49	mhartington	soo the change to the sidemenu were more than just css and some js changes
2014-12-12 10:46:09	mhartington	it much more to being a navigation base
2014-12-12 10:46:15	ioudas	yeah
2014-12-12 10:46:39	mhartington	so when it comes into the dom, it gets treat as the main navigation root
2014-12-12 10:46:55	mhartington	which is why I change the side-menu to the popover
2014-12-12 10:46:59	ioudas	i managed to kinda recreate it, and could tell that it was changed that way.. however all of it works. except the scrolling. so i am so close to the desired output. but if it cant scroll, it cant scroll.
2014-12-12 10:47:01	ioudas	yeah
2014-12-12 10:47:52	mhartington	tester/nrf456 ?
2014-12-12 10:48:17	ioudas	yes
2014-12-12 10:49:09	mhartington	weird, not working for me
2014-12-12 10:49:21	mhartington	maybe its taking a while to propagate 
2014-12-12 10:49:22	ioudas	hmm lemme ask the cobol guy if hes doin somethin
2014-12-12 10:51:13	ioudas	send the updated scrolling side menu code base
2014-12-12 10:51:20	ioudas	other guy has the token code open atm
2014-12-12 10:51:56	ioudas	will have ya in, in a sec
2014-12-12 10:54:46	ioudas	can ya try now?
2014-12-12 10:55:19	mhartington	working now
2014-12-12 10:55:23	mhartington	thanks !
2014-12-12 10:55:26	ioudas	np
2014-12-12 10:56:12	mhartington	okay, so I'm looking over what I sent you
2014-12-12 10:56:31	mhartington	not getting that slide-box issue you mentioned 
2014-12-12 10:56:41	ioudas	hmm can you go to stock
2014-12-12 10:56:43	ioudas	hit back
2014-12-12 10:56:46	ioudas	then hit back from result
2014-12-12 10:57:58	mhartington	nothing, working fine on my end
2014-12-12 10:58:10	ioudas	even the convering of the unit of measure on the stocking?
2014-12-12 10:58:50	mhartington	did you see this after you added the side-menu back?
2014-12-12 10:59:05	mhartington	just tried that, still working fine
2014-12-12 11:00:07	mhartington	which pages has the sdiemenu added back?
2014-12-12 11:00:10	mhartington	and the nav buttons?
2014-12-12 11:01:53	ioudas	no, before. 
2014-12-12 11:01:58	ioudas	the result page does
2014-12-12 11:02:00	ioudas	the filter
2014-12-12 11:02:04	ioudas	button pops it out
