2014-11-24 13:02:22	FalsePozitive	hello, friendly people! Please give me a tip, I'm using the sidemenu template and want to apply a background image to a single template page. I've tried adding to .scrol-content but no joy. any ideas?
2014-11-24 13:02:44	@mhartington	FalsePozitive: try adding it to the ion-view
2014-11-24 13:02:59	FalsePozitive	wont that apply it across all templates?
2014-11-24 13:03:12	@mhartington	not if you add a class to the ionic view
2014-11-24 13:03:17	FalsePozitive	sneaky
2014-11-24 13:03:22	@mhartington	<ion-view class="foo"

2014-11-24 13:07:29	FalsePozitive	i added a class like so

2014-11-24 13:08:01	@mhartington	FalsePozitive: yup, just like you would any other html element
2014-11-24 13:08:21	FalsePozitive	not showing up at all though
2014-11-24 13:08:36	FalsePozitive	coould it be the z-index?

2014-11-24 13:17:26	@mhartington	is the url relative to the css file?
2014-11-24 13:18:22	FalsePozitive	insofar as the image file is in my img folder in the www directory of my ionic installation

2014-11-25 09:57:45	jarr0dsz	would <ion-side-menus> be a solution for that?

2014-11-25 14:50:13	Marble68	I have a footer bar and want an icon on the right side - I’ve tried menu-title, ion-nav-button, etc.… is the only way to do this is three divs? Or is there a class setting I can use?
2014-11-25 14:55:10	Marble68	<div align-title="right" class="bar bar-footer bar-calm"><button menu-title="left" class="button icon-right ion-ios7-barcode-outline">Scan</button></div>
2014-11-25 14:55:24	qwebirc5360	that's what you have?
2014-11-25 14:55:36	Marble68	qwebirc39800: yeah -
2014-11-25 14:55:50	Marble68	that’s what I have - and I’m trying to get the scan button to be on the right side of the footer bar
2014-11-25 14:55:58	qwebirc5360	ok, i'm gonna give it a try
2014-11-25 14:56:42	qwebirc5360	what i used was the ionic grid
2014-11-25 14:56:51	qwebirc5360	i mean: row> col ...
2014-11-25 14:57:05	qwebirc5360	div.row>div.col
2014-11-25 14:57:14	Marble68	- ah - css
2014-11-25 14:58:10	qwebirc5360	not quite
2014-11-25 14:58:19	qwebirc5360	it's the built in grid
2014-11-25 14:58:23	qwebirc5360	from the framework
2014-11-25 14:58:46	qwebirc5360	but i guess there's have to be an option
2014-11-25 14:58:49	qwebirc5360	I'm checking
2014-11-25 14:58:53	Marble68	class=“grid”?
2014-11-25 14:59:27	Marble68	all.
2014-11-25 14:59:32	Marble68	http://learn.ionicframework.com/formulas/using-the-grid/
2014-11-25 14:59:44	qwebirc5360	yeah
2014-11-25 15:00:40	qwebirc5360	oh, i used a button
2014-11-25 15:01:28	qwebirc5360	i think what you want is something like: footer-bar > button button icon

2014-11-25 15:03:14	Marble68	a simple align="right"
2014-11-25 15:03:17	Marble68	I’m over thinking it
2014-11-25 15:03:27	qwebirc5360	why don't you use <ion-footer-bar> </ion-footer-bar>
2014-11-25 15:04:10	Marble68	I’m working with the side bar sample project
2014-11-25 15:04:18	Marble68	it doesn’t put a footer bar in the menu.html file
2014-11-25 15:04:36	Marble68	it uses class bar-footer
2014-11-25 15:04:50	Marble68	I’ll try it though

2014-11-26 10:49:22	@mhartington	navViewCtrl.title(val);
2014-11-26 10:49:41	beckyconning_	and how does that make its way into the nav bar?

2014-12-02 11:19:19	christo_m	however it looks like ionic has its own utility for dealing with projects that is cordova based syntax.
2014-12-02 11:19:48	christo_m	am i still able to use it? also, for my cordova app, it is just a shell that points to js/html assets on a remote server, am i able to do this with ionic or am i required to bundle everything before shipping.

2014-12-02 13:58:53	robdubya	did you inclide ionic in your apps' module?
2014-12-02 13:59:02	robdubya	eg angular.module('yourapp', [ 'ionic' ]

2014-12-02 17:46:15	Marble68	here’s the issue I’m having  - is the directive is hardcoded - i would like to set this via CSS
2014-12-02 17:46:20	Marble68	THAT would be the best solution
2014-12-02 17:47:28	Marble68	another would be if width is greater than height - then screen orientation would be more suited to the responsive menu being visible.

2014-12-03 09:54:48	chux	Is this the correct way to work with angular/ionic?
2014-12-03 09:55:22	chux	The problem what I'm facing is that sometimes, when the view is rendered I don't have the data yet
2014-12-03 09:55:25	dmack	chux: looks good. I'd move that into a service for more re-usability, but that'll work.
2014-12-03 09:55:32	dmack	use a resolve.
2014-12-03 09:55:43	chux	The thing is, I'm loading contact data

2014-12-03 10:10:55	ioudas	before executing
2014-12-03 10:10:58	ioudas	you dont have to chain
2014-12-03 10:11:05	ioudas	but a single promise would look like this

2014-12-03 10:15:55	ioudas	yeah its a big part of angular
2014-12-03 10:16:02	ioudas	you eventually wanna move to chained promises
2014-12-03 10:16:12	ioudas	in terms of learning
2014-12-03 10:16:15	ioudas	with chained rejection as well

2014-12-03 10:17:04	chux	I have to deliver the project next monday
2014-12-03 10:17:09	chux	haha
2014-12-03 10:17:27	arkin	nested promises can be a pain
2014-12-03 10:18:07	chux	the thing is, i have something like this
2014-12-03 10:18:08	chux	$scope.googleMapUrl = function()
2014-12-03 10:18:18	chux	That generates a google map url using some data
2014-12-03 10:18:31	chux	and that data is fetched via json
2014-12-03 10:18:51	ioudas	arkin, i got that 500 error nailed
2014-12-03 10:18:59	ioudas	but i cant get a 2nd promise to cancel the pop up
2014-12-03 10:19:02	chux	what's the easy way to tell angular, or ionic, you wait till the object is here
2014-12-03 10:19:04	arkin	wahey sorry i had to take a few work calls
2014-12-03 10:19:07	chux	then render the map
2014-12-03 10:19:09	ioudas	no worries
2014-12-03 10:19:15	arkin	got some code, i'll take a look?
2014-12-03 10:19:18	ioudas	sure
2014-12-03 10:19:25	ioudas	chux
2014-12-03 10:19:26	ioudas	a promise
2014-12-03 10:19:28	arkin	chux, promises or a callback
2014-12-03 10:19:34	ioudas	or a wait
2014-12-03 10:19:36	ioudas	function
2014-12-03 10:19:44	ioudas	i graduated from callbacks/waits to promises tho ;-)
2014-12-03 10:19:57	ioudas	$scope.$watch('WaitForMe', function(){
2014-12-03 10:19:57	ioudas			if(timer){

2014-12-03 10:20:00	arkin	so something like getGoogleUrl( parameter, function( url ) { // we have the google url !

2014-12-03 10:20:02	ioudas		});
2014-12-03 10:20:18	arkin	then getGoogleUrl( paramter, callback ) { // do something then callback( url );
2014-12-03 10:20:20	ioudas	thats what i use to do instead of promises lol
2014-12-03 10:20:29	arkin	oh dear lol
2014-12-03 10:20:37	arkin	I have to callback everything with WebSQL its a nightmare
2014-12-03 10:20:58	chux	$watch?
2014-12-03 10:21:14	chux	I think I will stop the whole project and finish my angular book
2014-12-03 10:21:17	chux	and take it easy
2014-12-03 10:21:17	arkin	chux, checks the variable every x seconds to see if its changed, very bad performance
2014-12-03 10:21:29	chux	seriusly, i don't get anything haha
2014-12-03 10:21:30	arkin	chux, a $http call is a promise

2014-12-03 10:26:36	ioudas	that works  (mostly)
2014-12-03 10:26:42	ioudas	if the cancel is not pressed
2014-12-03 10:26:46	ioudas	and the promise resolves.

2014-12-03 10:28:08	ioudas	its essentially a long search cancel button

2014-12-03 15:15:06	ioudas	hmmm
2014-12-03 15:15:13	jonasliljestrand	so today I have tested crosswalk (running ok now). But didnt do anything on performance
2014-12-03 15:15:15	ioudas	i deployed to an ipad 2 and didnt see lag.
2014-12-03 15:15:51	jonasliljestrand	so i thought, hey lets test the nightly build its angular 1.3.5 after all :)
2014-12-03 15:15:58	jonasliljestrand	And guess what, HUGE performance win

2014-12-04 09:30:28	@mhartington	but something in c/obj-c/java
2014-12-04 09:30:40	christo_m	oh nvm looks like dragging is for a type of scrolling.
2014-12-04 09:31:17	iksik	mhartington: uhm, well golang seems to support NDK so i figured, i'll ask ;D
2014-12-04 09:32:07	@mhartington	iksik: ahh, sounds like you may know a bit more then I do on the subject
2014-12-04 09:32:23	@mhartington	if android supports it, then you should be able too...should
2014-12-04 09:32:31	iksik	don't know much yet, just reading stuff
2014-12-04 09:34:11	christo_m	mhartington: any idea on how to do what im trying to do?
2014-12-04 09:34:46	@mhartington	so a mini http server inside of a cordova app?
2014-12-04 09:35:15	christo_m	http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/touch-coordinates-touchmove/8971 oh this may work
2014-12-04 09:36:28	@mhartington	iksik: the only example that I'm aware of is this plugin here, but it's written in obj-c 
2014-12-04 09:36:29	@mhartington	https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/WKWebView/tree/master/src/ios
2014-12-04 09:37:01	@mhartington	but again, its set up like a plugin, so you may want to go down that path
2014-12-04 09:37:27	iksik	uhm
2014-12-04 09:40:20	christo_m	how would i use on-touch with http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/touch-coordinates-touchmove/8971
2014-12-04 09:40:39	christo_m	it looks like on-touch is a directive, but am i able to pass teh event to the controller so i can use ionic.tap.pointerCoord(event) on it to get the coordinates?

2014-12-05 12:43:14	christo_m	mhartington: show the keyboard.
2014-12-05 12:45:26	@mhartington	well you could add this to your config.xml
2014-12-05 12:45:32	@mhartington	<preference name="KeyboardDisplayRequiresUserAction" value="false" />
2014-12-05 12:46:34	christo_m	ok
2014-12-05 12:46:36	christo_m	added
2014-12-05 12:47:01	@mhartington	this, plus .focus(); should work
2014-12-05 12:47:17	christo_m	mhartington: and whats the method for keeping the input hidden somehow
2014-12-05 12:47:22	christo_m	just z-index it to some negative value?
2014-12-05 12:48:00	@mhartington	hmm, I think I missing something, why do you need to show the keyboard but hide the input?
2014-12-05 12:48:16	christo_m	okay, so basically the app controls your pc remotely
2014-12-05 12:48:23	christo_m	the input field would technically be on the computer
2014-12-05 12:48:42	christo_m	basically i want to just show the keyboard when the user presses the keyboard UI element, so they can start typing and sending these key presses to their PC
2014-12-05 12:48:52	@mhartington	ahhh alrigth
2014-12-05 12:48:58	christo_m	when i say keyboard UI element, i mean like an actual keyboard button
2014-12-05 12:49:05	christo_m	they press it, keyboard comes up in their device OS
2014-12-05 12:49:06	@mhartington	yeah then z-index or opacity:0
2014-12-05 12:49:27	christo_m	mhartington: im probabyl going to have to disable ionic from scrolling to the element also right?
2014-12-05 12:49:48	@mhartington	this scroll? cordova.plugins.Keyboard.disableScroll
2014-12-05 12:49:50	christo_m	i think by default it does something akin to that, because i tried the focus trick and it would scroll down and hide the keyboard instantly
2014-12-05 12:50:08	christo_m	ugh, i gurantee that wont work as its still saying cordova.plugins.Keyboard is undefined
2014-12-05 12:50:11	christo_m	but i will try
2014-12-05 12:50:18	@mhartington	yeah you'll want to use this, which will disable the native scroll
2014-12-05 12:50:31	@mhartington	are you using the ionic keyboard or the cordova keyboard?
2014-12-05 12:50:52	christo_m	mhartington: well im using that plugin.
2014-12-05 12:51:11	@mhartington	and was this project created from out CLI?
2014-12-05 12:51:13	christo_m	beyond that i dont know, i think id like to use the ionic one
2014-12-05 12:51:23	christo_m	its all CLI
2014-12-05 12:51:47	christo_m	im not sure what the pros/cons are of each keyboard though
2014-12-05 12:51:48	@mhartington	well the ionic-keyboard should be automatically added by default

2014-12-05 12:52:10	christo_m	okay
2014-12-05 12:52:23	christo_m	so do i even need this plugin then?
2014-12-05 12:52:39	@mhartington	well the plugin links I've been sending you is ours 
2014-12-05 12:52:41	christo_m	i saw a lot of posts where you replied saying its recommended to use this plugin
2014-12-05 12:52:45	christo_m	okay
2014-12-05 12:52:54	christo_m	im just confused because the package name is cordova.plugins.Keyboard..
2014-12-05 12:53:07	christo_m	but its ionic-plugins-keyboard
2014-12-05 12:53:22	@mhartington	well its a fork/update
2014-12-05 12:53:47	@mhartington	so we kept that the same, but just changed the package name
2014-12-05 12:54:14	christo_m	okay going to retry with scrolling disabled
2014-12-05 12:55:08	christo_m	mhartington: yup still undefined

2014-12-05 12:55:32	christo_m	thats all im doing.
2014-12-05 12:55:33	@mhartington	hmmm weird, on what kind of device?
2014-12-05 12:55:50	christo_m	ipod
2014-12-05 12:55:53	christo_m	ios 7
2014-12-05 12:56:11	christo_m	sorry, ios 6.1.3

2014-12-05 12:57:14	@mhartington	http://pastie.org/9763008
2014-12-05 12:57:34	@mhartington	6.1.3? why that low?
2014-12-05 12:58:13	christo_m	i guess a lot of our users still run on older ios devices
2014-12-05 12:58:15	christo_m	so for testing we use this
2014-12-05 12:58:51	@mhartington	well I mean, apple does require ios7 be the minimum sdk version now
2014-12-05 12:58:57	@mhartington	so just a heads up
2014-12-05 12:59:26	christo_m	mhartington: weird.. ionicPlatform is undefined also..
2014-12-05 12:59:31	christo_m	do i need to inject these things into the controller?
2014-12-05 12:59:33	christo_m	thats probably it
2014-12-05 12:59:47	@mhartington	well $ionicPlatform yes
2014-12-05 12:59:58	christo_m	ah yes i missed that in your paste
2014-12-05 12:59:59	@mhartington	but the keyboard pluing probably not
2014-12-05 13:00:14	@mhartington	keep forgetting about device ready stuff
2014-12-05 13:00:28	christo_m	nope still an error
2014-12-05 13:00:34	christo_m	i dont think its a matter of the device being ready
2014-12-05 13:00:43	christo_m	because i press that button well after the app has loaded.
2014-12-05 13:00:59	christo_m	ive also had mixed results with ionicPlatform. specifically when i load our bonjour plugin.. i opted instead to do a 3 second timeout.
2014-12-05 13:01:08	christo_m	sorry, ionicPlatform.ready
2014-12-05 13:01:38	@mhartington	let me give it a shot
2014-12-05 13:02:00	@mhartington	could be the ios version as well, but I'll test it out

2014-12-09 09:33:00	ioudas	the ng-show logic is the same regardless of how you do it
2014-12-09 09:33:12	ioudas	it has to have a true expression, and its based on the controller you started it with
2014-12-09 09:33:46	ioudas	i do not see a controller properly set for the index
2014-12-09 09:33:50	ioudas	in a state provider
2014-12-09 09:33:52	ioudas	or in the view
2014-12-09 09:34:03	ioudas	then you need to fix the show
2014-12-09 09:34:04	JFlash_	ok makes sense
2014-12-09 09:34:09	ioudas	console.log your expression
2014-12-09 09:34:12	ioudas	and your scoped variable
2014-12-09 09:34:15	ioudas	to diagnose
2014-12-09 09:34:18	JFlash_	so I should add some controller to the footer?
2014-12-09 09:34:24	ioudas	wouldnt hurt to test
2014-12-09 09:34:31	ioudas	i personally defined them in my view at the top
2014-12-09 09:34:32	ioudas	of the view
2014-12-09 09:34:50	ioudas	but everyone has their preferences... i had some oddities i didnt like with controllers and state provider
2014-12-09 09:35:07	ioudas	index.html does not get defined with a view tho

2014-12-09 09:36:31	ioudas	i can fix the code if you get stuck
2014-12-09 09:36:34	ioudas	too
2014-12-09 09:36:42	ioudas	you can also do the logic in the controller

2014-12-11 11:49:54	Marble68	I don’t want to do it for *ALL* item-content classes - just the ones on this template

2014-12-11 12:14:45	@perryg	i am, what's up?
2014-12-11 12:17:33	ioudas	was wondering if you had some time to help with a state provider issue i am having since upgrading to nightly
2014-12-11 12:17:40	ioudas	its screwed my back buttons up real good
2014-12-11 12:17:55	ioudas	and i cant figure out what/how to change
2014-12-11 12:19:50	@perryg	:)
2014-12-11 12:19:56	@perryg	try a pull from master
2014-12-11 12:20:11	@perryg	adam just pushed a fix related to that
2014-12-11 12:20:38	ioudas	yeah, but i upgraded from beta 13 to nightly which uses uses a different version no?
2014-12-11 12:20:44	ioudas	like 2.10 vs 2.7?
2014-12-11 12:21:23	 *	ioudas installs
2014-12-11 12:21:25	@perryg	of UI router? yeah, to get the old router to work with angular 1.3 required some hacks
2014-12-11 12:21:31	ioudas	ah
2014-12-11 12:21:37	ioudas	and thats included in 889
2014-12-11 12:21:39	ioudas	?
2014-12-11 12:22:18	@perryg	adam just updated to UI Router 2.13 a few mins ago that doesn't require the old hacks and so far so good
2014-12-11 12:22:42	@perryg	we're hopeful that will address a number of nightly bugs people were seeing
2014-12-11 12:24:30	ioudas	so itd be possible to just recorde by state provider in the new ui router
2014-12-11 12:24:31	ioudas	hmm
2014-12-11 12:24:40	ioudas	yeah didnt fix it
2014-12-11 12:25:04	@perryg	ah, kk. was worth a shot. what specifically are you seeing?
2014-12-11 12:25:25	ioudas	back buttons have changed to go to different views, when i navigate to a view. code executes. but view is never changed
2014-12-11 12:25:35	ioudas	back buttons dont exist on views that use to exist
2014-12-11 12:25:39	ioudas	dont
2014-12-11 12:26:43	ioudas	i can show you if you want
2014-12-11 12:26:59	ioudas	sounds like i just have to write it in 2.13 or w/e

2014-12-11 12:33:10	ioudas	its confusing because as i try to change the view names and such it doesnt work like mhartington's example... and im kinda confused at the new syntax.
2014-12-11 12:33:29	ioudas	Part of me wonders if i should just ditch it, and just make my own back buttons
2014-12-11 12:33:31	 *	ioudas ponders
2014-12-11 12:34:46	@perryg	looks like you already have your own in some places
2014-12-11 12:35:01	ioudas	i tried one on the stock
2014-12-11 12:35:20	ioudas	thats pretty much the only $state.go that works really anymore other than the product search/result
2014-12-11 12:35:38	ioudas	the arrow button on the page use to work like the back button
2014-12-11 12:35:40	ioudas	:-/
2014-12-11 12:36:34	@perryg	so when i do a product search, and i get in to a detail view, i see two back buttons. one takes be to the previous page, the other takes me to the root page of that tab, the main product search page
2014-12-11 12:36:54	@perryg	*takes me
2014-12-11 12:37:24	ioudas	yep, they use to work identical pre, when i had beta 13.
2014-12-11 12:37:59	ioudas	the back button use to go to the result. the diagram is basically this
2014-12-11 12:41:06	ioudas	the user logs in. goes to the product search tab. makes a search.. and gets results. The back button to the search page here is now gone. If you open a product... and hit a detail of that product. Stock check is the only state that now works. There are three states there depending on the product. Accessories, stock, pricing. All go back to the result page. All of which either i cant navigate to. or the back buttons do not work.
2014-12-11 12:41:39	@perryg	did something just change? i'm suddenly getting  TypeError: Cannot read property 'dyelot-recordsItems' of undefined
2014-12-11 12:41:40	ioudas	all should go back to the result page*

2014-12-12 09:45:04	niop	in /css, there's ionic.css, which is the stock ionic css file, and ionic_mybuild.css, which is the grunt generated one.  can choose which to reference in index.html.

2014-12-12 09:55:05	niop	but one is to include ionic.css + generated sass.  i'm not sure what the difference is between them. i would have thought the sass stuff would be the proper complete definition of ionic.css.
2014-12-12 09:55:25	niop	no, lineman. but for the sake of simplying the problem, just using grunt on the test app at the moment.

2014-12-12 09:56:06	@mhartington	hmm, alright, so what are you importing into your working scss file?

2014-12-12 10:10:08	niop	there are different sass compile modules for grunt that could be used. so if one isn't working another might.  an option.
2014-12-12 10:11:35	niop	but it seems like the approach is right at least. just the css not being composed it seems as it should. well, your name looks familiar, so if that's right, well, i guess this going to have to be resolved this end.  expertise doesn't improve much more over that way.  unless some grunters around.
2014-12-12 10:11:45	@mhartington	niop: yeah, it could be the module

2014-12-12 10:36:54	@mhartington	ioudas: hey, whats up?
2014-12-12 10:37:19	ioudas	couple questions. I have a few nav bar buttons, on the accesorry pages. I cant get them to work anymore since the changes yesterday.
2014-12-12 10:37:21	ioudas	Kinda confused...

2014-12-12 10:37:51	@mhartington	hmm, has anything changed in the code since yesterday?
2014-12-12 10:38:32	ioudas	if i use that code base I still have the issue. However I was playing last night, 2nd peice of my question. I managed to implement the side menu with the back buttons....  and made it work, however the scroll content doesnt work.
2014-12-12 10:39:51	ioudas	was wondering if theres a way to get around that. If not, i can convert it back. but thought you might find it interesting to look at/see.
2014-12-12 10:40:04	ioudas	same with the converting button on the stock check.
2014-12-12 10:40:53	ioudas	also
2014-12-12 10:41:04	ioudas	found another bug with the code base you gave me
2014-12-12 10:41:21	ioudas	when using the back button. to a page with a slide box, it destorys all the widths of the slide box.
2014-12-12 10:41:37	ioudas	I fixed this by turning the caching off for the view....
2014-12-12 10:41:45	ioudas	and that seems to work

2014-12-12 11:21:36	christo_m	Should i be using the navbar if i want to put custom elements in there?
2014-12-12 11:21:46	Marble68	hi all - which tag do I apply styles to modify header h1’s? I’ve only been able to apply minor tweaks like uppercase, but not change font color -  any ideas?
2014-12-12 11:22:03	christo_m	for instance im trying to replicate a browser, with an input box for address etc
2014-12-12 11:22:27	christo_m	i noticed when i pop new views up the nav bar is always there, in this instance its still in the DOM tree even though this new page has a header that im trying to use
2014-12-12 11:23:58	@mhartington	christo_m: you can do this, if you're using the nightly builds
2014-12-12 11:24:23	@mhartington	http://ionicframework.com/docs/nightly/api/directive/ionNavTitle/
2014-12-12 11:24:32	christo_m	im not unfortunately
2014-12-12 11:24:38	christo_m	im also not using bower because our project existed before bower
2014-12-12 11:24:45	christo_m	so i guess ill have to manually copy the files
2014-12-12 11:24:53	@mhartington	ahh alright
2014-12-12 11:25:09	@mhartington	in that case, you could use ion-header-bar.bar-subheader
2014-12-12 11:25:09	christo_m	thats exactly what i want though.
2014-12-12 11:25:23	@mhartington	(excuse the jade markup)
2014-12-12 11:25:53	christo_m	maybe i should just try nightly
2014-12-12 11:27:23	@mhartington	hopefully we'll be pushing it to beta soon, so this could be a good chance to start a project with the cli and test things out
2014-12-12 11:27:34	@mhartington	see what may need to be refactored and such
2014-12-12 11:28:40	@mhartington	Marble68: you can target the headers title with .bar-header .title{}
2014-12-12 11:28:50	christo_m	mhartington: you're saying i should try and port everything into an ionic app proper
2014-12-12 11:28:53	christo_m	?
2014-12-12 11:29:11	christo_m	gah i dunno if thats a good investment of time right this second..
2014-12-12 11:29:14	christo_m	but i guess i should
2014-12-12 11:29:24	@mhartington	not necessarily
2014-12-12 11:29:35	Marble68	mhartington: I’ll try that I’m doing h1.title
2014-12-12 11:29:43	christo_m	well i really like using bower and tools to handle dependency management
2014-12-12 11:29:48	christo_m	i certainly dont want to be copying js files in the future
2014-12-12 11:30:03	@mhartington	but you could use the cli to have a testing directory for new features and such
2014-12-12 11:30:08	christo_m	ah i see
2014-12-12 11:30:18	@mhartington	but using bower would be a +1 soo 
2014-12-12 11:30:23	@mhartington	:D
2014-12-12 11:30:48	christo_m	mhartington: see even if i use bar-subheader. the issue still is that navbar is showing
2014-12-12 11:30:52	christo_m	its in the DOM
2014-12-12 11:31:18	christo_m	this is because i have it in the main parent view
2014-12-12 11:31:19	Marble68	mhartington: nope
2014-12-12 11:31:36	christo_m	under which i have an <ion-view> then my new page is being dumped in there and im trying to have it have its own header
2014-12-12 11:31:42	@mhartington	http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionView/
2014-12-12 11:31:56	@mhartington	you can hide the nav-bar on a view-by-view case
2014-12-12 11:32:04	christo_m	ah i see
2014-12-12 11:32:07	christo_m	they've left it empty there
2014-12-12 11:32:35	christo_m	that is really confusing dude
2014-12-12 11:33:12	christo_m	mhartington: http://pastie.org/9776813 this is it currently

2014-12-12 11:33:42	christo_m	thats the page , which is basically like a full screen pop up
2014-12-12 11:33:50	christo_m	that page is going to have nested content etc

2014-12-12 13:28:16	ioudas	make your own nav bar button

2014-12-12 13:28:53	christo_m	it isnt really that confusing.
2014-12-12 13:28:54	ioudas	oh
2014-12-12 13:28:57	christo_m	i just want to pop off the stack.

2014-12-12 13:29:32	ioudas	well, ionic makes those based on the sub elements of a view. by default. if its nested, but there is a function
2014-12-12 13:29:43	ioudas	im not sure why you cant just do it in UI router.. but i dont know your use case
2014-12-12 13:29:46	ioudas	lemme see if i can find it
2014-12-12 13:30:42	ioudas	http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionNavBackButton/
2014-12-12 13:30:46	ioudas	goBsack
2014-12-12 13:30:49	ioudas	lookup
2014-12-12 13:30:53	ioudas	$ionicNavBarDelegate:
2014-12-12 13:31:03	ioudas	$scope.goBack = function() {

2014-12-12 13:32:50	christo_m	yes that works, thank you
2014-12-12 13:32:57	christo_m	though id prefer to use the state because thta makes sense..
2014-12-12 13:32:59	christo_m	but ya, it works
2014-12-12 13:33:01	ioudas	yeah
2014-12-12 13:33:04	ioudas	i think you can do that...
2014-12-12 13:33:09	ioudas	just depends how you structure
2014-12-12 13:33:17	ioudas	i do that for related views of mine in the ui router
2014-12-12 13:34:13	ioudas	like http://pastebin.com/QuXtU0G2
2014-12-12 13:34:23	christo_m	hmm
2014-12-12 13:34:30	ioudas	then i can make states nested further
2014-12-12 13:34:33	ioudas	for each state
2014-12-12 13:34:48	ioudas	based on the . notation
2014-12-12 13:36:28	christo_m	yes i do that also
2014-12-12 13:36:30	christo_m	however this page that pops up
2014-12-12 13:36:32	christo_m	is the parent.

2014-12-12 13:36:56	christo_m	from there i nest things. so absolutely that will work
2014-12-12 13:37:05	ioudas	rgr
2014-12-12 13:37:06	christo_m	though $state.go('^') is supposed to go to its parent. so that should work when its nested.

2014-12-12 14:29:02	windsurf_	ioudas: i don’t know why the back button appears though, it’s a root view going to another root view
2014-12-12 14:29:18	windsurf_	is disabling the back button a band-aid or… ?
2014-12-12 14:29:19	ioudas	probably the ^
2014-12-12 14:29:30	ioudas	you dont need the $state.go either to go back

2014-12-12 14:29:41	ioudas	but im runnin real low on sleep
2014-12-12 14:29:45	windsurf_	it’s not a nested view and so I’m not trying to go back
2014-12-12 14:29:49	ioudas	oh
2014-12-12 14:29:55	windsurf_	the use case is: I have two views: Home and Account.
2014-12-12 14:30:06	windsurf_	Account is a view that becomes inaccessible once you tap sign-out
2014-12-12 14:30:13	ioudas	is that
2014-12-12 14:30:17	windsurf_	when you tap sign-out I want to return the user to Home
2014-12-12 14:30:19	ioudas	myUserProfile
2014-12-12 14:30:28	windsurf_	myUserProfile is the Account view yes
2014-12-12 14:30:43	ioudas	that seems weird then
2014-12-12 14:30:44	ioudas	yes
2014-12-12 14:30:46	ioudas	your conf is off
2014-12-12 14:30:55	windsurf_	cool, I’m all ears :)
2014-12-12 14:31:17	windsurf_	all eyes* :
2014-12-12 14:31:18	ioudas	why does it have the same defined view as home?
2014-12-12 14:31:47	ioudas	also why is it a subset of the abstract
2014-12-12 14:31:59	ioudas	like home is
2014-12-12 14:32:08	ioudas	brb

2014-12-12 14:54:37	christo_m	if i do put the <ion-content> wrap first, the contents of page.keyboard.html will show for a second during the transition, then disappear
2014-12-12 14:55:31	christo_m	also the title isnt populated even though im using <ion-view title="">
2014-12-12 14:56:05	christo_m	im getting fucking confused between ion-nav-view and ion-view so im going to read the docs again but this so super annoying.
2014-12-12 14:56:43	christo_m	apparently that title attribute will tell the parent ion-nav-bar, but how do i tell the parent nav header ?

2014-12-15 12:18:34	windsurf_	Everything I’ve been reading/watching about ui-router tells me I should be able to navigate to a sibling root view with $state.go(‘^.home’) and that does happen but the nav bar gets confused (shows back button and side-menu button) and history is wrong (clicking back button goes to previous sibling view). how can I do this properly? is it a bug in Beta 13?
2014-12-15 12:19:26	windsurf_	my app is structured the same as http://demo.ionicframework.com/nightly/ionSideMenus/navWithMenu/#/app/playlists and the use case would be using $state.go to navigate between /playlists and /search

2014-12-15 13:14:10	ioudas	its a pretty "simple" app. basically its a product lookup app. Will let you login to the company's back end data. Will let you make searches on their products. Check stock, pricing, accessories. Let you order the products. Give you order history info as well. Also will probably be doing claims from it.
2014-12-15 13:14:22	ioudas	whats interesting is it goes from angular to php to a soap cobol backend.

2014-12-15 14:51:53	@perryg	so you can do page specific caching

2014-12-15 16:23:58	@perryg	looking for what the change is
2014-12-15 16:23:59	ingsoc	ionic always had lots of good ideas but with some rough edges (performance wise)
2014-12-15 16:24:05	<--	mitchellhenke (~mitchellh@64.250.96.102) has quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
2014-12-15 16:24:09	ingsoc	i like the persistent DOM/VIews
2014-12-15 16:24:10	windsurf_	is anyone available for some paid support time?
2014-12-15 16:24:19	ingsoc	and switching to angular 1.3 should give some gains
2014-12-15 16:24:27	christo_m	perryg: ya i mean, i can see the nav for a second before it transitions. then it gets hidden with "hide" classes on the buttons etc
2014-12-15 16:24:30	christo_m	for some reason.
2014-12-15 16:24:34	@perryg	right, the changes in this release center around enabling the best performance possible
2014-12-15 16:24:40	Foxandxss	hybrid apps have the performance downside but everyday that is getting better
2014-12-15 16:25:03	@perryg	there were some self-imposed bottlenecks we needed to remove before a 1.0
2014-12-15 16:25:07	ingsoc	Foxandxss:  deffo, I have also been impressed with material angular on chrome on modern android
2014-12-15 16:25:24	@perryg	that's us too fwiw
2014-12-15 16:25:27	Foxandxss	ingsoc: yeah, can't wait until material arrives to ionic
2014-12-15 16:25:32	BahamutWC|Work	we saw some perf issues with angular material I believe
2014-12-15 16:25:40	@perryg	and we're incorporating parts of it
2014-12-15 16:25:51	Foxandxss	BahamutWC|Work: that shouldn't surprise for now
2014-12-15 16:25:51	ingsoc	well i haven't done much with it, but a few tests here and there
2014-12-15 16:26:10	ingsoc	webUI is deffo the way forward
2014-12-15 16:26:11	Foxandxss	the day you can use material design in every android where ionic runs is a huge win
2014-12-15 16:26:18	Foxandxss	material design on native is a pain imho
2014-12-15 16:26:34	ingsoc	CSS keyframes etc when HW accellerated can be just like native
2014-12-15 16:26:55	ingsoc	(smoothness of animation etc.
2014-12-15 16:27:47	christo_m	perryg: im gonna try and look at the $ionicNavBarDelegate stuff now, because thats just a straight up console error
2014-12-15 16:27:51	christo_m	with stack trace
2014-12-15 16:28:06	@perryg	check out the new nav transitions
2014-12-15 16:28:14	ingsoc	the other slight issue is it would be good to have some more options for tabley screen format
2014-12-15 16:28:18	ingsoc	tablet*
2014-12-15 16:28:22	@perryg	christo_m: yeah, please do. i'll dig around the nav bar stuff
2014-12-15 16:28:57	christo_m	k
2014-12-15 16:29:14	@perryg	ingsoc: you know about the open sidemenu view for tablet, right?

2014-12-15 16:30:47	christo_m	perryg: looks like its deprecated now

2014-12-15 16:32:06	@perryg	si
2014-12-15 16:32:10	ingsoc	perryg: have you kept any sort of internal speed benchmarks ?,  has there been much difference with 1.3.  apparently there is quite a performance improvement but with desktop it is less evident as machines are so fast.  Would be interesting with mobile as there is a fine line between things looking a lil choppy and being smooth to the human eye
2014-12-15 16:32:18	-->	mitchellhenke (~mitchellh@64.250.96.102) has joined #ionic
2014-12-15 16:32:48	@perryg	there's a big improvement with large watch cycles
2014-12-15 16:33:01	@perryg	you also have bind-once
2014-12-15 16:33:09	@perryg	which can help a lot
2014-12-15 16:33:15	ingsoc	also, regarding the persistent/sticky states, I had already been using a mechanism in ui-router-extras for desktop angular dev that enabled a similar thing
2014-12-15 16:33:19	@perryg	on the ionic side, we added view caching
2014-12-15 16:33:46	@perryg	you'll want to turn it off on particularly large views, but it helps a lot
2014-12-15 16:33:56	ingsoc	yeah view caching I think sounds like sticky states in http://christopherthielen.github.io/ui-router-extras/#/home
2014-12-15 16:34:27	@perryg	also, we were able to improve the navigation/transition process to make it lot easier on phones to process but also look sexier

2014-12-15 16:34:30	ingsoc	yeah deffo,  I had a use case for having lots of markers displayed on a web map and this was a pain to keep rebuilding when navigating to/from
2014-12-15 16:34:42	Foxandxss	when you said cached views which are "there" but "hidden", they are still $digest-ed, right?
2014-12-15 16:34:56	@perryg	they are not
2014-12-15 16:35:03	ingsoc	oooohhhhh
2014-12-15 16:35:05	@perryg	well...
2014-12-15 16:35:07	ingsoc	that IS interesting then
2014-12-15 16:35:08	@perryg	not actively
2014-12-15 16:35:29	Foxandxss	hidden dom is still digested
2014-12-15 16:35:33	@perryg	the controller is saved off to the side and removed from the watch cycle
2014-12-15 16:35:42	Foxandxss	I see
2014-12-15 16:35:53	@perryg	so the existing digest is saved, but it's not actively digested anymore
2014-12-15 16:35:53	ingsoc	so you can kinda disable remove the scoep from the digest temporarily ?
2014-12-15 16:35:56	ingsoc	ah ok
2014-12-15 16:35:57	ingsoc	lol
2014-12-15 16:36:07	ingsoc	cool
2014-12-15 16:36:32	ingsoc	is this all optional ?
2014-12-15 16:36:41	Foxandxss	yes
2014-12-15 16:37:34	ingsoc	cool.  it seems we are fast approaching the day when hybrid apps will be the default and special requirements (games etc.) will be where native gets used more and more
2014-12-15 16:37:54	Foxandxss	native has its use cases I guess
2014-12-15 16:38:13	@perryg	there's some good game libs out there in the works too
2014-12-15 16:38:14	Foxandxss	I am not sure how hybrid tackles notifications, background services and stuff, I guess that some of them are simply not possible
2014-12-15 16:38:25	christo_m	perryg: looks like there are no docs on $ionicHistory
2014-12-15 16:38:33	@perryg	cordova plugins
2014-12-15 16:38:48	@perryg	http://ngcordova.com/
2014-12-15 16:38:58	ingsoc	Foxandxss:  The point I am making is there will be less requirement/reasons to go native right off the bat
2014-12-15 16:39:14	@perryg	http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/service/$ionicHistory/
2014-12-15 16:39:27	christo_m	perryg: weird i couldnt find it by searching the docs..
2014-12-15 16:39:28	ingsoc	e.g. at the moment people still can argue that even a productivity app on hybrid is still not quite smooth enough to be truly professional
2014-12-15 16:39:37	ingsoc	but this gap is closing
2014-12-15 16:39:42	@perryg	the search may have not yet indexed
2014-12-15 16:39:46	christo_m	ah true
2014-12-15 16:40:10	Foxandxss	seems like ngCordova doc is getting better
2014-12-15 16:40:11	Foxandxss	that is good
2014-12-15 16:41:49	@perryg	yeah, it outgrew it's original layout
2014-12-15 16:43:00	Foxandxss	snippets where really short and sometimes you had to check the source

2014-12-15 17:08:12	christo_m	cant see a difference
2014-12-15 17:08:45	@perryg	try a native app on your phone with sidemenues
2014-12-15 17:09:13	christo_m	no i mean
2014-12-15 17:09:14	christo_m	code wise.
2014-12-15 17:09:18	christo_m	i dont know what you did to fix it perryg

2014-12-15 17:10:39	christo_m	looks like you ended up using side="primary"
2014-12-15 17:11:16	@perryg	so ionic thought the second page you clicked without clicking on a sidemenu button was to a child view. so i told it the page I'm going to is supposed to be a root page in startApp()

2014-12-15 17:12:57	@perryg	which is why i used the solution i did

2014-12-16 10:45:54	Marble68	In the side menu example, what would be the approach to adding a button that doesn’t scroll at the bottom? I’ve tried putting it outside ion-content; but it disappears when I do that. When I set the ion-content to a height of it’s parent, I do get whitespace behind it, but — anyway - it there a way to divide up a template into two ion-contents? One that scrolls and one that doesn’t?

If I set "overflow-scroll" to "true", the problem goes away

2014-12-16 14:29:44	@perryg	christo_m: there's a lot going on in these examples. let me try to put together a more isolated example in codepen
2014-12-16 14:30:33	christo_m	perryg: i think the biggest difference between what you had in your codepen and what i have here is that i have some screens transitioning
2014-12-16 14:30:42	christo_m	i really hope this doesnt have anything to do with that $ionicHistory stuff.
2014-12-16 14:33:41	christo_m	perryg: also i have the ion-nav-title loading a directive
2014-12-16 14:33:51	christo_m	though i dont think that would be the issue
2014-12-16 14:34:19	christo_m	i also shoved the state into the rootScope currently because i couldnt figure out why my controller wasnt seeing its grandparent
2014-12-16 14:34:24	christo_m	its a horrible controller.
2014-12-16 14:36:12	@perryg	ok, so you have buttons inside ion-nav-bar
2014-12-16 14:36:37	christo_m	correct, top level
2014-12-16 14:36:49	@perryg	specifically ion-side-menu > ion-side-menu-content > ion-nav-bar
2014-12-16 14:36:54	christo_m	correct.
2014-12-16 14:39:39	@perryg	*just looking at this against the new docs...
2014-12-16 14:40:46	@perryg	the ng-controller might cause problems, especially if that's where you scope vars are set
2014-12-16 14:41:19	@perryg	^navBarController
2014-12-16 14:42:28	@perryg	that's really the only difference I see
2014-12-16 14:43:10	christo_m	perryg: i use $rootScope
2014-12-16 14:43:32	@perryg	are you able to get rid of the ng-controller?

2014-12-16 14:47:25	christo_m	that view has its own controller, though i shouldnt have defined it with ng
2014-12-16 14:47:27	christo_m	should probably use the router
2014-12-16 14:49:06	@perryg	yeah, ng-controller with UI router is playing with fire
2014-12-16 14:49:24	christo_m	perryg: you know what though
2014-12-16 14:49:28	christo_m	i think when i get navigated

2014-12-16 15:38:10	christo_m	true , into ng-hide, that should work right?
2014-12-16 15:38:44	@perryg	it's really tough to tell from a code snippet
2014-12-16 15:39:02	christo_m	how?
2014-12-16 15:39:06	christo_m	its ng-hide true
2014-12-16 15:39:11	christo_m	that should hide it, period.
2014-12-16 15:39:12	christo_m	full stop
2014-12-16 15:39:52	@perryg	well, that's evaluating the string "true"
2014-12-16 15:40:04	@perryg	i forget if that evaluates to the boolean true
2014-12-16 15:40:11	@perryg	I think it would
2014-12-16 15:40:23	@perryg	but that's not the whole story
2014-12-16 15:40:37	christo_m	okay
2014-12-16 15:40:39	@perryg	there's also the root nav bar
2014-12-16 15:40:43	christo_m	ill put 'true == true'
2014-12-16 15:40:46	christo_m	or something
2014-12-16 15:40:46	broberson	"true" is true. "false" is also true
2014-12-16 15:41:07	broberson	But I think those values are interpreted as booleans.
2014-12-16 15:41:07	christo_m	okay so it should evaluate to true and hide.
2014-12-16 15:41:28	christo_m	perryg: that snippet is the only instance of ion nav buttons in the entire project.
2014-12-16 15:41:31	christo_m	they are not hiding.

2014-12-16 15:47:04	Jensen2k	Hi guys, new in this channel (yay). Struggling to understand child states for ui-router in ionic. I thought i just could navigate a stack with child states, but it's not working. Here is a plunker to show what i thought should work: http://plnkr.co/edit/Szi5siDmVuMGu84DQyVC?p=preview
2014-12-16 15:47:41	@perryg	buttons get copied/moved from the page template to the root navbar. it's that root navbar that you actually see. whether the ion-nav-buttons is shown or not is irrelevant

2014-12-16 16:52:56	christo_m	perryg: if you click the toggle button, it resizes the input as you expect
2014-12-16 16:53:13	christo_m	if you click the white space underneath the button (basically not the button) then toggle it, it doesnt resize.
2014-12-16 16:53:35	christo_m	basically im getting mixed results with the align
2014-12-16 16:54:36	christo_m	i think the timeout actually needs like 100 ms or something
2014-12-16 16:54:46	@perryg	yeah, i'm thinking so too
2014-12-16 16:54:56	@perryg	thanks for the codepen, this helps a lot
2014-12-16 16:55:03	christo_m	:(
2014-12-16 16:55:06	christo_m	its your codepen
2014-12-16 16:55:06	@perryg	digging in to it
2014-12-16 16:55:28	@perryg	yeah, but this is an accurate example of the problem
2014-12-16 16:55:37	christo_m	the problem is if i put the time out, when i blur the box to put the icons back, they will momentarily go over top of the input box which sucks
2014-12-16 16:55:48	christo_m	i guess i can timeout the reveal

Since it can't resolve the routes through the http-server, it just returns a "Cannot get /something". Would be nice if it reloaded on the index, but solved it by just turning of html5-mode

2014-12-17 10:45:49	dmack	lemme try that.
2014-12-17 10:45:58	christo_m	ya just do that before a $state.go
2014-12-17 10:45:59	@perryg	since controllers aren't re-initialized on subsequent visits anymore, we provide a bunch of events you can listen for http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionView/
2014-12-17 10:46:42	dmack	basically the use case is, I hjave a list of items. user "ticks" off these items, when they're all complete, I show a modal. a button in this modal takes them back to the home screen.
2014-12-17 10:46:55	dmack	I have a $watch setup to determine when all of the items are ticked
2014-12-17 10:47:02	dmack	which works

2014-12-17 13:59:25	windsurf_	yep, sorted it out mhartington. Navigating from one root view to another used to get the header in a weird back button state where A) it HAD a backbutton and shouldn’t have and B ) it also had a menu icon. Now it’s working properly when I do $ionicHistory.nextViewOptions with both disableBack and historyRoot set to true

2014-12-17 15:23:34	andrew9183	ah, is there an option to change it or is it standard

2014-12-18 09:51:08	begginer	Hello guys. I am kinda new to Ionic. I just starded new project with version 1.0.0-beta.14. and my data from services is no longer available in other functions from the same service. my english is bad, so here is the pastebin to get a clearer picture: http://pastebin.com/vM0zppbk
2014-12-18 09:51:13	@mhartington	another way is to use $ionicHistory.currentTitle('string'); arkin
2014-12-18 09:51:27	arkin	which one is preferred mhartington ?
2014-12-18 09:51:43	@mhartington	two ends to the same means, doens't matter
2014-12-18 09:51:48	@mhartington	doesn't*
2014-12-18 09:52:46	arkin	ok
2014-12-18 09:52:47	arkin	thanks
2014-12-18 09:52:57	begginer	data is set with pullCategories(); and that same data in function getData() is empty :\... anyone having this problems? or what am I doing wrong. any help would be great. I am going mad :) tnx in advance.

2014-12-18 09:54:04	arkin	mhartington: also earlier I was using http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/publishing.html to publish my app on android
2014-12-18 09:54:21	arkin	mine got built to ant-build/ not bin/ and had a different name
2014-12-18 09:55:12	christo_m	begginer: can you console.log data before you make the get request in pullCategories?
2014-12-18 09:56:49	christo_m	begginer: http://pastebin.com/ywT0iSYa i wrap my service/factory in an object, and return that object
2014-12-18 09:56:56	@mhartington	arkin: interesting about $ionicHistory, would you be able to open an issue for this?
2014-12-18 09:57:06	begginer	@christo_m sure, its an empty object

2014-12-18 09:58:06	arkin	I'll create an issue on github now
2014-12-18 09:58:23	christo_m	begginer: http://plnkr.co/ maybe try putting your service in there with a small controller and view for it
2014-12-18 09:58:32	christo_m	so we can see the whole thing
2014-12-18 09:59:38	begginer	I will try that now, just a min
2014-12-18 10:01:22	begginer	huh, i never used plunker, it will be interesting :)
2014-12-18 10:01:44	begginer	3 mins
2014-12-18 10:02:48	frankblizzar	is there some event fired after the side menu is opened / clsoed
2014-12-18 10:03:52	christo_m	frankblizzar: http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/service/$ionicSideMenuDelegate/ you can use this to check if its open.
2014-12-18 10:04:03	christo_m	not sure about events fired though
2014-12-18 10:04:13	frankblizzar	yeah i saw that thanks
2014-12-18 10:04:30	frankblizzar	would be better in my case to just listen to an event
2014-12-18 10:04:40	christo_m	frankblizzar: you can $watch those

2014-12-18 12:46:26	christo_m	okay so, im having an issue with ng-hide and ng-show, where for a second before the view is loaded ill see the elements flash
2014-12-18 12:46:31	christo_m	is there a way to remedy this? prehaps im coding it wrong?
2014-12-18 12:46:55	christo_m	these vars are evaluated in the controller, but there isnt a lot of heavy logic there.. they're also instantiated by default to hide when the controller is lodaed.
2014-12-18 12:46:58	christo_m	loaded*
2014-12-18 12:47:37	christo_m	mYd1: you can try forcing the title to "center"
2014-12-18 12:47:51	christo_m	mYd1: with align-title, i noticed the same thing, it stopped defaulting to center for me after the update.

2014-12-18 12:52:41	christo_m	mhartington: ya sorry, just experienced the same issue ioudas had posted about in the forums
2014-12-18 12:52:45	christo_m	im going to try the ng-if fix
2014-12-18 12:52:51	ioudas	it fixes it for sure
2014-12-18 12:53:01	christo_m	it doesnt seem as clean though
2014-12-18 12:53:21	ioudas	it isnt cause ng-hide/show doesnt do that, but i dint really have to rework much
2014-12-18 12:53:24	ioudas	if anything
2014-12-18 12:53:49	@mhartington	well we haven't done anything to change how hide/show work
2014-12-18 12:53:57	christo_m	ya it must be an angular thing
2014-12-18 12:53:59	ioudas	yeah
2014-12-18 12:54:01	@mhartington	but we did update to angular 1.3.6
2014-12-18 12:54:03	christo_m	well it 100% is.
2014-12-18 12:54:21	ioudas	either way, it makes ng-hide/show unusable in a lot of areas.
2014-12-18 12:54:32	ioudas	i had to rewrite ng-show on like 4 screens
2014-12-18 12:55:04	christo_m	ya its not a big deal
2014-12-18 12:55:07	christo_m	just a find and replace.
2014-12-18 12:55:14	christo_m	but it is removing the element from the DOM
2014-12-18 12:55:19	ioudas	yeah only had it in a few spots where there was susbstantial elements
2014-12-18 12:55:19	christo_m	so its doing unnecessary DOM manipulation
2014-12-18 12:55:30	christo_m	which affects performance i think
2014-12-18 12:55:30	ioudas	to be hidden
2014-12-18 12:55:41	@mhartington	yeah, let me ping perry and see whats up

2014-12-18 13:08:36	@mhartington	derp, not ng-leave, thats for ng-if

2014-12-18 17:15:29	christo_m	weird..
2014-12-18 17:15:37	christo_m	im trying to inject what i put in the router resolve
2014-12-18 17:15:42	christo_m	dmack: http://pastie.org/9788980
2014-12-18 17:16:15	christo_m	its saying its wrong though.
2014-12-18 17:16:26	dmack	what is test() returning?
2014-12-18 17:16:39	dmack	oh, wait
2014-12-18 17:16:50	dmack	I think it's because you don't have a controller defined.
2014-12-18 17:16:57	dmack	may have to move that up to your parent
2014-12-18 17:17:18	christo_m	uhhh, what
2014-12-18 17:17:42	dmack	you're resolving data on a state taht has no controller
2014-12-18 17:17:49	dmack	move that resolve up to the parent state
2014-12-18 17:17:51	christo_m	ahhh
2014-12-18 17:17:56	dmack	I think
2014-12-18 17:18:19	dmack	brb
2014-12-18 17:19:19	christo_m	heh that worked
2014-12-18 17:19:25	christo_m	except it dumped [object Object] into my view lmao
2014-12-18 17:19:28	christo_m	dammit
2014-12-18 17:19:37	christo_m	kk ill figure it out
2014-12-18 17:21:10	christo_m	its probably nested
2014-12-18 17:22:53	dmack	so ui-router lets you inherit resolves from parent -> child
2014-12-18 17:23:06	dmack	if you define a controller for that child state, you can still inject the resolve into it
2014-12-18 17:23:37	christo_m	ya i got that
2014-12-18 17:25:53	christo_m	hmm its not loading the html properly

2014-12-19 10:25:34	arkin	welcome
2014-12-19 10:27:24	canthugeverycat	I have an issue that needs resolving, and I'm not experienced in it. I made an ionic app that uses angular-file-upload plugin to upload an image on a server. The thing is, it works on PC and iOS but it doesn't work on Android. The only images I can upload on android are png's. When I choose jpg or gif for upload the app just gets reloaded
2014-12-19 10:27:42	arkin	canthugeverycat: are you debugging it?

2014-12-19 10:29:14	arkin	er, first make sure remote debugging is on too
2014-12-19 10:29:16	canthugeverycat	How can I watch the console if I'm testing the app on android ?

2014-12-19 10:54:49	canthugeverycat	@arkin I have done that
2014-12-19 10:55:17	arkin	do you see your android application to inspect?
2014-12-19 10:55:28	canthugeverycat	@arkin I have enabled remote debugging, I can see my device, but I can't see my app because I didn't enable it on the app
2014-12-19 10:55:43	arkin	afaik you dont have to enalbe it on the app
2014-12-19 10:55:53	canthugeverycat	@arkin Don't really know where to paste that code from https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews
2014-12-19 10:56:03	arkin	yea
2014-12-19 10:56:08	arkin	you dont need that code

2014-12-19 10:56:13	canthugeverycat	Give me a second
2014-12-19 10:56:23	arkin	canthugeverycat: basically launch your device using ionic command line tools and it should show up
2014-12-19 10:56:51	canthugeverycat	@arkin What I do is build the app and then install in on my phone. Is there a quicker way ?
2014-12-19 10:57:05	arkin	yea enable USB debugging in developer options
2014-12-19 10:57:10	arkin	and the command will run it for you

2014-12-19 13:16:52	ioudas	how the key signing works on android
2014-12-19 13:16:55	ioudas	would be a good start
2014-12-19 13:17:00	ioudas	i got a key for my app
2014-12-19 13:17:00	jonasliljestrand	its quite easy
2014-12-19 13:17:02	canthugeverycat	Okay
2014-12-19 13:17:04	jonasliljestrand	what platform are u on?
2014-12-19 13:17:06	ioudas	from google
2014-12-19 13:17:09	ioudas	windows
2014-12-19 13:17:21	ioudas	i see the key signer.. im not sure how that generates a key
2014-12-19 13:17:21	canthugeverycat	ugh
2014-12-19 13:17:23	ioudas	that matches google
2014-12-19 13:17:31	ioudas	i have linux boxen if needed
2014-12-19 13:17:45	canthugeverycat	You used google to generate a key ?
2014-12-19 13:17:46	canthugeverycat	What ?
2014-12-19 13:17:48	ioudas	i got a mac for the ios side obviously
2014-12-19 13:18:01	ioudas	i set up my app and it gave me a base 64 license key
2014-12-19 13:18:03	ioudas	for the app
2014-12-19 13:18:19	jonasliljestrand	http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html
2014-12-19 13:18:35	canthugeverycat	I followed this guide
2014-12-19 13:18:42	jonasliljestrand	if you have mac I would do the manual signing
2014-12-19 13:18:45	jonasliljestrand	its really easy
2014-12-19 13:18:46	canthugeverycat	Also, it's separate for ios and android, it's two apps not one
2014-12-19 13:19:27	jonasliljestrand	Then in your platforms/android folder i would create a file called ant.properties
2014-12-19 13:19:58	jonasliljestrand	key.store=/<path-to-your-key/release-key.keystore
2014-12-19 13:20:07	jonasliljestrand	key.alias=youralias
2014-12-19 13:20:26	jonasliljestrand	this will be used when execuing cordova build android --release

2015-01-05 13:20:57	@mhartington	essentially, it runs the gulp-sass task to compile the ionic.app.scss into ionic.app.css
2015-01-05 13:21:19	windsurf_	ohh
2015-01-05 13:21:22	windsurf_	that's gulp-sass?
2015-01-05 13:21:27	@mhartington	yep
2015-01-05 13:21:36	@mhartington	so you could do gulp sass
2015-01-05 13:21:38	@mhartington	and compile things
2015-01-05 13:21:44	windsurf_	but for that way you'd have to have two cli commands running in parallel right?
2015-01-05 13:22:02	@mhartington	or ionic serve, which would compile sass and build your project
2015-01-05 13:22:07	@mhartington	^
2015-01-05 13:22:32	windsurf_	ionic serve is one command and without doing ionic setup sass am i right that you'd have to do ionic serve AND the sass watch as two separate commands?

2015-01-05 13:41:41	@mhartington	if you don't have sass setup for a project, it the ionic cli won't compile scss or have the gulp tools need to compile sass
2015-01-05 13:42:31	@mhartington	if you run ionic setup sass, which will install all the gulp tools needed, you will then be able to compile sass

2015-01-05 16:02:28	SLJ	hello everyone in #ionic; I'm new to IonicFramework and noticed 14 beta is out which uses Angular 1.3.6.  Is there a way to make it work with Angular 1.3.8?
2015-01-05 16:03:00	SLJ	Is it even worth the trouble?  Thx

2015-01-05 16:28:05	@perryg	looks like you two have been chatting for a while, can you paraphrase the problem?
2015-01-05 16:28:10	DrMabuse_	i render a list with nested item in item
2015-01-05 16:28:27	ioudas	he has a problem with rendering on a device, and no way to debug it for a nested item perryg
2015-01-05 16:28:31	DrMabuse_	so on Brwoser the list redner
2015-01-05 16:28:54	DrMabuse_	on device the html exist and  i can see the the first items
2015-01-05 16:29:03	DrMabuse_	but when i scroll down
2015-01-05 16:29:05	@perryg	ic, so Ionic isn't really configured to handle lists within a list
2015-01-05 16:29:11	DrMabuse_	the items are not visble but
2015-01-05 16:29:21	DrMabuse_	i can click on it
2015-01-05 16:29:25	DrMabuse_	ok
2015-01-05 16:29:33	DrMabuse_	so i have put this out
2015-01-05 16:29:34	@perryg	It may be more simple to just add a style for things that should be sub-lists
2015-01-05 16:29:53	DrMabuse_	ok thx perryg
2015-01-05 16:30:00	@perryg	and have them all be siblings in the DOM

2015-01-05 16:30:40	DrMabuse_	ok
2015-01-05 16:30:41	ioudas	i wonder how the accordion example does it.
2015-01-05 16:30:45	 *	ioudas ponders
2015-01-05 16:30:59	@perryg	but it sounds like you're also having issues with inspecting on the element
2015-01-05 16:31:04	@perryg	*on the device
2015-01-05 16:31:34	DrMabuse_	i doesnt see any erros on console if you mean that
2015-01-05 16:31:39	@perryg	do you know how to open a web inspector for your app while it's plugged in to your computer?
2015-01-05 16:31:50	DrMabuse_	iam usin gapdebug
2015-01-05 16:31:55	DrMabuse_	and yes i know
2015-01-05 16:32:15	DrMabuse_	how to inspect it
2015-01-05 16:32:26	@perryg	ah, kk. i can't help you with gap:debug, but if you want to get and inspector with safari or chrome going, I can help you with that
2015-01-05 16:32:50	@perryg	**man, I have tons of typos today
2015-01-05 16:33:02	@mhartington	DrMabuse_: if you can get an plunkr or codepen together, I can give you a hand, feel free to PM me
2015-01-05 16:33:26	DrMabuse_	perryg thx but i know this very well i think otherwise you do something others then safari -> developer
2015-01-05 16:33:47	DrMabuse_	mhartington: ok thx
2015-01-05 16:33:59	@perryg	yeah
2015-01-05 16:34:24	@perryg	here's an example of nested-like items in ionic on an app i'm working on
2015-01-05 16:34:24	@perryg	https://github.com/driftyco/front-page/blob/master/www/templates/tab-comments.html
2015-01-05 16:34:39	DrMabuse_	its not so easy because my api only works over vpn but i will add a quick example
2015-01-05 16:34:48	ioudas	yeah, perryg thats like the accordion example.
2015-01-05 16:34:48	@perryg	so for each level down, I'm just adding padding-left
2015-01-05 16:35:03	DrMabuse_	ok cool
2015-01-05 16:35:36	@perryg	np
2015-01-05 16:35:42	DrMabuse_	thx dudes

2015-01-05 18:30:15	@perryg	under the hood, they're intertwined. however, i'd caution against using browser history. that suggests you're building your app with a linear navigation path, like a website. As ionic matures, you're going to have multiple, concurrent, and interdependent timelines and histories. It's better to think of it in terms of views and states rather than pages
2015-01-05 18:30:44	@perryg	this is already somewhat the case in side menu and tabs

2015-01-21 15:50:57	crushkill	a function is triggered to draw a css canvas over top of an image

2015-01-21 16:35:15	fairuz	and looks like a live reload feature. so maybe all the files are being transfered to your device?

2015-01-21 16:38:29	fairuz	not when angular use it
2015-01-21 16:39:00	fairuz	Look at the livereload time line

2015-01-21 16:39:59	fairuz	it should be fine :)

2015-01-21 16:41:14	fairuz	hm ionic has livereload now?
2015-01-21 16:41:27	fairuz	maybe I should start using ionic's cli lol
2015-01-21 16:41:38	BahamutWC|Laptop	livereload is easy to build in yourself
2015-01-21 16:41:41	fairuz	instead of primitive cordova cli :)
2015-01-21 16:41:41	frem	I started from a template; I don't remember if it was included or if it was something I added.
2015-01-21 16:41:45	BahamutWC|Laptop	using grunt-livereload or gulp-livereload
2015-01-21 16:41:54	fairuz	ah right
2015-01-21 16:41:59	BahamutWC|Laptop	also it still doesn’t fix how slow the build process is with cordova
2015-01-21 16:42:03	\malex\	the ionic live reload works very well!
2015-01-21 16:42:45	fairuz	From the snapshot, I see files being transfered. Who initiate this? ionic js in the app?
2015-01-21 16:43:47	frem	That's the result of hitting the reload button in chrome.
2015-01-21 16:44:14	fairuz	wait so this is not on the device? or the two connected somehow?

2015-01-21 16:45:24	crushkill	would it be a best practice to offload processing work to a webserver via php or something like that?
2015-01-21 16:45:28	crushkill	w/ ionic?
2015-01-21 16:45:36	fairuz	what local webserver? You need local webserver now?
2015-01-21 16:45:44	crushkill	no for a live app
2015-01-21 16:45:51	fairuz	crushkill: depends. Normally for dynamic data, you cna always do ajax call to a remote server
2015-01-21 16:46:04	fairuz	former message is not for your crushkill :)

2015-01-21 16:46:40	crushkill	im diagnosing a 100% cpu when an image is being loaded/analyzed via ionic+javascript ... im starting to think maybe image processing and whatnot should just be offloaded to a web service
2015-01-21 16:47:03	crushkill	if people dont typically use ionic / phonegap / cordova in this way, i shouldn't try to debug this type of issue
2015-01-21 16:47:32	frem	fairuz: I'm using the ionic serve command. It's a super basic local webserver. I'm using it because chrome doesn't seem to like it when pages it's reading off disk make ajax requests.

2015-01-23 12:14:06	Milind	I need some help
2015-01-23 12:14:13	@mhartington	I'm on the ionic team
2015-01-23 12:14:13	Milind	if you don't mind
2015-01-23 12:14:21	@mhartington	whats up?

2015-01-23 12:15:24	Milind	please
2015-01-23 12:16:05	@mhartington	Hey Foxandxss hows it going
2015-01-23 12:16:19	Foxandxss	good, ended checking the ionic course at pluralsight
2015-01-23 12:16:22	Foxandxss	not bad
2015-01-23 12:16:43	Milind	This is my first app which I am making
2015-01-23 12:16:53	Milind	Hope you guys will help me
2015-01-23 12:16:56	@mhartington	Milind: hmm, so it seem that we would need to update our version of angular
2015-01-23 12:17:06	Milind	yea
2015-01-23 12:18:01	@mhartington	So a quick fix would be to include all the components individually, like in that plunkr

2015-01-23 12:18:37	Milind	So will it not conflict
2015-01-23 12:18:45	Milind	or make heavy app
2015-01-23 12:18:47	@mhartington	Foxandxss: yeah looked over that course. A few things here and there I didn't like, but over all really good
2015-01-23 12:19:21	@mhartington	Shouldn't, wouldn't effect the size since ionic.bundle.js is essentially all those files combinded into one
2015-01-23 12:19:25	Foxandxss	mhartington: for example? There were a few things on the code that could be done better (I did them better on my own codE)
2015-01-23 12:19:46	Foxandxss	and the gmap part is pretty f* up :P
2015-01-23 12:20:01	@mhartington	yeahh, mostly that
2015-01-23 12:20:11	@mhartington	but we weren't a part of that 
2015-01-23 12:20:21	@mhartington	they jsut went ahead and made it
2015-01-23 12:20:28	Milind	ok thank you
2015-01-23 12:20:29	@mhartington	thats OSS for ya
2015-01-23 12:20:38	Foxandxss	mhartington: which is not a bad thing
2015-01-23 12:20:46	@mhartington	Milind: np, sorry about the delay on the forum, been super busy 
2015-01-23 12:20:56	Milind	no problem its ok
2015-01-23 12:21:00	Foxandxss	my ionic is now better than before
2015-01-23 12:21:04	Foxandxss	and that is what all is about
2015-01-23 12:21:41	@mhartington	exactly
2015-01-23 12:21:43	Milind	So when can i expect clean solution
2015-01-23 12:21:51	Milind	Sorry I am asking more but :(
2015-01-23 12:22:04	@mhartington	ah no worries, valid question
2015-01-23 12:22:31	@mhartington	I can open an issue for it and try to see if we can get in the next release

2015-01-27 10:45:30	teufelChiCoder	from what i read so far, WP just coming around with JSON API
2015-01-27 10:46:34	christo_m	teufelChiCoder: why do you want to do that.
2015-01-27 10:46:42	teufelChiCoder	do what?
2015-01-27 10:47:14	teufelChiCoder	got a client that wants to use their original website, which was built in WP
2015-01-27 10:48:30	christo_m	teufelChiCoder: well then yes, expose a JSON api for the stuff they actually want.
2015-01-27 10:48:35	christo_m	otherwise get a mobile theme for their site lol
2015-01-27 10:49:10	teufelChiCoder	well yeah, mobile theme would be logical way to go, if they didnt want to develop a mobile app
2015-01-27 10:49:29	teufelChiCoder	site already has been mobile optimized and etc
2015-01-27 10:50:12	christo_m	teufelChiCoder: then you want an API for angular to hook into
2015-01-27 10:50:33	teufelChiCoder	yeah
2015-01-27 10:50:50	christo_m	im sure theres some core stuff they want as the app?
2015-01-27 10:50:58	christo_m	or is it just a trend these days to make apps out of peoples sites.
2015-01-27 10:51:23	christo_m	maybe theres some shit out there that'll do the conversion im sure ive seen a bunch.. just appify your WP

2015-01-27 10:53:46	christo_m	should i just crosswalk it
2015-01-27 10:54:30	@mhartington	hmm, it probably would be for the best to use crosswalk
2015-01-27 10:54:42	@mhartington	but what exactly is the odd behavior? 
2015-01-27 10:54:51	christo_m	mhartington: the footer fails to attach to the soft keyboard
2015-01-27 10:55:00	christo_m	if i set a timeout before showing the keyboard, i can see the footer there.

2015-01-27 11:05:44	uchuff	hi all
2015-01-27 11:06:10	uchuff	just updated to b14 (and subsequently a nightly), slowly fixing things in my app
2015-01-27 11:06:34	uchuff	one item i wasn't sure  on, currently i have links (ui-sref) loading my various states ok, with nice transitions and back buttons
2015-01-27 11:06:57	uchuff	however one thing that breaks both of those is a couple of places where i link to a child view of an abstract view
2015-01-27 11:07:07	uchuff	* state

2015-01-27 11:07:46	uchuff	e.g. i have a "booking" state, which is abstract, and i actually link to "booking.products" which has siblings "booking.money", "booking.customers"
2015-01-27 11:08:48	max_at	i don't have problems with child states of abstract parent.
2015-01-27 11:08:50	uchuff	if i made "booking" an actual state and linked to it, I'm sure it would animate and get a back button nicely, but having "booking" as abstract and linking straight to "booking.products" seems to behave like the sidemenu links in that i get no animation and no back button (maybe it's a new history)
2015-01-27 11:10:09	uchuff	the state loads i just don't get the nice transition and the back button doesn't show

2015-01-27 11:10:11	max_at	oh, i just link there without transistions and stuff, never tried that.
2015-01-27 11:10:51	uchuff	maybe i need to restructure it so i have "booking" as an actual state, link to that and then have "money" and "customers" swap things out
2015-01-27 11:11:13	uchuff	saying that, sometimes i'll want to link directly to "booking.money" so that doesn't get me anywhere
2015-01-27 11:11:30	uchuff	maybe i need to look at nextViewOptions
2015-01-27 11:11:32	max_at	you don't transistion to "booking" directly since it has no view, oh?
2015-01-27 11:11:36	@mhartington	uchuff: do you have an example of this in a simplified codepen?

2015-01-27 11:44:40	uchuff	although i guess i could just edit the state to make it not abstract

2015-01-27 12:46:33	dcadenas	christo_m: ok no problem. so you would not recommend using "content src"? the nice things it that you can update apps without hiting apple
2015-01-27 12:49:04	christo_m	dcadenas: ya thats why we use it too
2015-01-27 12:49:13	christo_m	im sure its fine, its just getting problematic for the size of our app
2015-01-27 12:49:32	christo_m	dcadenas: im just starting to use the ionic tool, does it not watch your JS folder and automatically do the includes on your index.html or?
2015-01-27 12:51:04	christo_m	oh no, the gulp file says it only watches scss :(
2015-01-27 12:51:25	christo_m	well then nvm, i thought this thing would be more helpful for doing minification and includes for you automagically
2015-01-27 12:53:20	dcadenas	well I'm currently doing everything with the rails backend tools, so my index.html has dependencies to js and css already processed by rails (compressed, minified, etc), so I'm not depending so much in the ionic tooling
2015-01-27 12:53:36	dcadenas	christo_m: keep in mind I'm a ionic newbie
2015-01-27 12:53:51	dcadenas	I may be doing everything wrong!
2015-01-27 12:53:56	christo_m	the ionic cli looks like a simple wrapper for cordova to me xD
2015-01-27 12:54:06	christo_m	basicalyl gives you some templating options when starting
2015-01-27 12:54:18	christo_m	also fetches the master and unzips it so you dont have to bother with that i guess
2015-01-27 12:54:41	christo_m	i just thought it was like angular-fullstack where it'll help you configure controllers etc
2015-01-27 12:54:51	christo_m	but i guess thats because its a yeoman generator, which would be nice for ionic
2015-01-27 12:56:21	@mhartington	So the ionic cli is more than just a wrapper for cordova
2015-01-27 12:56:54	@mhartington	as we start rolling out our serves, it will provide a crazy simple way to add things like Analytics, Push Notifications, etc
2015-01-27 12:57:16	@mhartington	But we are looking at things like the yeoman generator for larger scale apps
2015-01-27 12:57:43	@mhartington	and how can we take that approach but make it much simpiler 
2015-01-27 12:57:48	christo_m	mhartington: ya im sorry i didnt mean to sound offensive about it
2015-01-27 12:57:55	christo_m	i know its actually helpful, it just isnt worth it for me personally to switch
2015-01-27 12:57:58	christo_m	right now.
2015-01-27 12:58:04	dcadenas	yes, the main benefit I see in the cli are all the emulation and uploading tasks
2015-01-27 12:58:28	@mhartington	haha, oh I konw you weren't, just wanted to share our thoughts behind it 
2015-01-27 12:58:33	@mhartington	all good :)
2015-01-27 12:59:15	christo_m	yeoman style would be nice though.. one of the hardest things for me when i started learning ionic/angular a month or two ago was trying to figure out best practice to keep everything neat

2015-01-27 13:05:49	christo_m	the model i see more often times on the internet is having "controller" "services" etc directories but that gets messy the minute your application has >10 controllers.

2015-02-03 15:29:59	raibutera	why would you want both @mhartington
2015-02-03 15:30:56	@mhartington	so that logic with app and www/ would be that app/ would build into www/
2015-02-03 15:31:14	@mhartington	so app would have unminified code and everything
2015-02-03 15:31:56	@mhartington	then get minified/uglified into www/, then transfered to the platforms 
2015-02-03 15:32:06	@mhartington	which is what yeoman generators do
2015-02-03 15:32:18	raibutera	i just want 1) automated test running on ionic serve and 2) minimise the amount of boilerplate I have to write when adding modules or directives/controllers/services

2015-02-03 15:34:54	@mhartington	by tests you mean jslint/jshint or unit tests?
2015-02-03 15:35:08	@mhartington	because that can be added now actually
2015-02-03 15:35:10	@mhartington	with gulp
2015-02-03 15:36:18	ioudas	Does anyone know how to make ui router fire a function on a state call? I would like to have a function to dispose the existing template and download a new one. Is this possible?
2015-02-03 15:36:59	@mhartington	raibutera: but things like directives/controllers/services commands are something we like as well

2015-02-04 14:38:58	guyman20	Yes, it does look like iOS. But does it mean ionic won't look like that/
2015-02-04 14:39:00	guyman20	?
2015-02-04 14:40:02	@perryg	that's bad because things wont be exactly the same. the way you interact with the app with be slightly different unless they time everything down to the millisecond and pixel to be the same. being so close, but not exact is worse than being pretty close
2015-02-04 14:40:46	guyman20	then where do you put ionic in the scale of native look&feel? If you want to avoid the valley, it should be somehwere around 6..

2015-02-04 15:01:45	marshall	cordovaStatusbar isn't doing anything i tell it to
2015-02-04 15:02:39	@perryg	there's no plans to focus on blackberry, but we're all for taking PRs from those who want to invest the time in it
2015-02-04 15:03:03	@perryg	and like i was saying, it works pretty well already
2015-02-04 15:03:10	guyman20	alright :)
2015-02-04 15:03:49	marshall	oh, it looks like the example in the docs for $cordovaStatusbar has a typo
2015-02-04 15:04:09	marshall	cordovaStatusBar vs. cordovaStatusbar
2015-02-04 15:04:53	guyman20	Will it be more comfortable using Corduva and not phonegap? I see most of the examples refer to corduva
2015-02-04 15:05:12	@perryg	they're related
2015-02-04 15:05:23	@perryg	phonegap is the build service
2015-02-04 15:05:52	guyman20	So what do I do with a folder named .corduva?
2015-02-04 15:05:54	@perryg	cordova is the open source project and phonegap and ionic both use to run HTML based apps on a device
2015-02-04 15:06:45	@perryg	for most purposes, you would only use phonegap to compile your app if you want
2015-02-04 15:06:49	guyman20	Not sure I understand - from what I figured, I use ionic with either corduva or phonegap. Isn't that so?
2015-02-04 15:07:08	@perryg	if you use the ionic CLI, you're using cordova
2015-02-04 15:07:21	@perryg	you can use cordova directly too
2015-02-04 15:07:43	@perryg	you can also use phonegap, the command lines are pretty interchangeable
2015-02-04 15:07:58	@perryg	because they're all based on cordova
2015-02-04 15:08:27	@mhartington	marshall: thanks for pointin that out, will fix it
2015-02-04 15:08:54	@perryg	phonegap and ionic add things though, like ionic, you can do serve, add ions, create projects based on codepens, add crosswalk etc...
2015-02-04 15:09:10	@perryg	phonegap, you can use their build service to compile your apps
2015-02-04 15:09:33	guyman20	perryg ok, I guess I'll understand that better once I start. Thank you :)
2015-02-04 15:10:29	@perryg	think of cordova like the linux kernel, and ionic and phonegap being ubuntu and redhat
2015-02-04 15:10:31	marshall	does cordovastatusbar work for you on ios? it's not doing anything for me

2015-02-04 17:45:37	@mhartington	ahh alright, duellsy, that makes sense 
2015-02-04 17:46:04	@mhartington	you can specify a proxy for this
2015-02-04 17:46:33	libin_v	mhartington: It does launch the register.html template. There I have a textfield on click of textfield, it give this erro
2015-02-04 17:46:54	duellsy	@mhartington how would I do that?
2015-02-04 17:46:56	@mhartington	libin_v: yeah then I'm not sure, is this on ios or android?
2015-02-04 17:47:06	libin_v	mhartington:  this is ios
2015-02-04 17:47:22	@mhartington	duellsy: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli#working-around-proxies
2015-02-04 17:47:26	@mhartington	this may help
2015-02-04 17:47:29	duellsy	thanks
2015-02-04 17:47:34	@mhartington	libin_v: ios7? 8?

2015-02-06 15:35:29	BahamutWC	really to be productive with Ionic, I'd recommend being productive with Angular
2015-02-06 15:35:57	BahamutWC	understanding angular, and how ionic interfaces with it is important IMO
2015-02-06 15:36:21	Schalla	BahamutWC, I am curious as new Angular+Ionic dev, how much code you can reuse from a regular angular website when using in a mobile app for ionic?
2015-02-06 15:36:39	Schalla	Shouldn't you be able to reuse most parts of it when the structure is not that much different?
2015-02-06 15:36:41	BahamutWC	Schalla: your views and controllers should pretty much be created from scratch

2015-02-06 15:37:14	BahamutWC	service logic can be ported, may need adaptation if you have too heavy of a reliance on other plugins that manipulate the DOM (i.e. UI Bootstrap)
2015-02-06 15:37:39	Schalla	Alright, thanks for a quick rating on that.

2015-02-06 15:38:08	Schalla	Just starting out with both Angular and Ionic, used till today only the classic PHP Framework with serverside template geneartion^^
2015-02-06 15:38:11	Schalla	*generation
2015-02-06 15:38:18	BahamutWC	I'd also say, try to make sure your app is structured in a way that puts Ionic first - otherwise you will have many pains
2015-02-06 15:38:47	BahamutWC	as with most frameworks, if you go against the conventions set by them, you will feel pain
2015-02-06 15:39:05	Schalla	True. Is there any resource you would recommend for starters or just dive in and try it?
2015-02-06 15:39:14	Schalla	I fiddled a little bit with the premade templates
2015-02-06 15:39:34	BahamutWC	Schalla: read the documentation, see some of the examples on their codepen (http://codepen.io/ionic/)
2015-02-06 15:39:45	BahamutWC	and of course, just building prototypes
2015-02-06 15:39:58	Schalla	Uhhh all codepens don't work for me?
2015-02-06 15:40:00	BahamutWC	I also like to read source code
2015-02-06 15:40:04	BahamutWC	?
2015-02-06 15:40:05	Schalla	oh nvm, just the previdw
2015-02-06 15:40:07	Schalla	*preview
2015-02-06 15:40:08	Schalla	Sorry.

2015-02-06 15:40:54	BahamutWC	haha
2015-02-06 15:40:55	Schalla	But thanks for the link, that will help!
2015-02-06 15:41:27	Schalla	Another question if you don't mind, the default theme shipped with ionic seems to be pretty much focused on iOS, right?
2015-02-06 15:41:53	Schalla	Is it recommended to start from scratch to create your own design or are there alternative stylesheets for android etc
2015-02-06 15:42:16	BahamutWC	Schalla: you can configure for Android as well
2015-02-06 15:42:32	BahamutWC	the tab bar appears on the top instead of the bottom on Android by default for example
2015-02-06 15:42:39	BahamutWC	that is all configurable though
2015-02-06 15:43:28	Schalla	Guess I will just continue to build my JSON API and then continue to try to make a App for it in Ionic. :) Thanks for the quick info BahamutWC

2015-02-09 13:14:20	christo_m	dammit
2015-02-09 13:14:51	@perryg	that makes hunting memory leaks considerably more difficult. can you run it on an android device and inspect through chrome there?
2015-02-09 13:15:12	@perryg	really, if you can fix it in chrome, it should be fixed in safari/uiwebview
2015-02-09 13:15:34	christo_m	perryg: the leak isnt occurring on android.
2015-02-09 13:15:54	@perryg	oh?
2015-02-09 13:16:15	christo_m	perryg: according to DDMS, its taking the same 14 mb as when i started the app hours ago
2015-02-09 13:16:23	@perryg	I'd start to be very skeptical of the plugin then
2015-02-09 13:16:29	christo_m	however in instruments, the ios app gets up to 140mb and i start getting memory errors
2015-02-09 13:16:36	@perryg	so, it grows even when it's idling?
2015-02-09 13:16:41	christo_m	perryg: no

2015-02-09 13:17:40	@perryg	some deducation may help, can you isolate what kind of actions get it to grow?
2015-02-09 13:17:43	christo_m	perryg: everytime theres a send firing, it seems to increase the footprint on iOS
2015-02-09 13:17:47	christo_m	perryg: any tcp event
2015-02-09 13:18:28	@perryg	the vars you're passing to the TCP call, are they dom elements or anything?
2015-02-09 13:18:45	christo_m	perryg: json strings
2015-02-09 13:18:46	@perryg	i can't imagine why they would be, just checking
2015-02-09 13:19:09	christo_m	perryg: i mean its the exact same code on both platforms so i know its something to do with chrome sockets implementation on teh iOS side
2015-02-09 13:19:13	@perryg	just to be safe, set that json var to null when you're done w/ it if possible
2015-02-09 13:19:35	@perryg	I'm pretty sure your issue is with the plugin though
2015-02-09 13:20:05	christo_m	i think so too.
2015-02-09 13:20:07	@perryg	oh, so there's no cordova plugin
2015-02-09 13:20:11	christo_m	no there is

2015-02-09 13:54:50	drmabuse	perryg: yes it is

2015-02-10 11:22:02	@maxlynch_	mzarella: you need a mac first, and then XCode. When you start a project, connect your phone and run "ionic build ios" "ionic run ios". There are some steps in between, like getting your ios dev license
2015-02-10 11:22:06	@maxlynch_	OR...or
2015-02-10 11:22:19	@maxlynch_	you can use ionic package to build the iOS binary for you, or download Ionic View to test on the phone, or try PhoneGap BUild
2015-02-10 11:22:25	mzarella	maxlynch_: are those stops documented somewhere?

2015-02-10 11:28:21	@perryg	you can use highchart too, but be sure to clean up when you're done, use jquery too remove the elements after you leave the page

2015-02-10 11:29:58	pagios_	works out of the box with ionic?
2015-02-10 11:30:31	RangerRick	there are some charting things that sit on top of d3 too that you could look into (eg, c3)

2015-02-10 11:31:28	@mhartington	some directives can help normalize things though
2015-02-10 11:31:31	RangerRick	ah, nvd3 looks nice too
2015-02-10 11:31:41	mzarella	any chance that in the future ionic will move toward react.js native?
2015-02-10 11:31:48	mzarella	and use material-ui instead of angular-material
2015-02-10 11:32:00	pagios_	i need something highlevel dont want to dig to make it integrate with ionicaugular.. wanna really focus on the charts not on the underlying thing :)
2015-02-10 11:32:14	@mhartington	pagios_: hense the diretives ;)
2015-02-10 11:32:25	RangerRick	I'm more interested in how react native handles the "js in a background thread" thing...  It was announced while I was on a cruise and I haven't had a chance to dig in yet.

2015-02-10 11:37:12	mzarella	but it would be nice to see ionic slowly get a plan together for this transition :)
2015-02-10 11:37:44	mzarella	this really is worth watching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY
2015-02-10 11:38:34	surfdue	RangerRick: so you did background fetch as opposed to push notifications?
2015-02-10 11:38:44	mzarella	it addresses the "i don't want to use react.js because it mixes different abstractions" argument
2015-02-10 11:38:47	RangerRick	surfdue: correct, since we couldn't receive push notifications on the boat
2015-02-10 11:39:07	mzarella	tldw; it doesn't, and the templating languages are limiting compared to js
2015-02-10 11:39:31	surfdue	RangerRick: well.. thats going to prove most challenging my only potential solution is to setup healthkit monitoring i guess
2015-02-10 11:40:22	mzarella	also part of the tldw; is that we start reinventing the wheel (services, factories, directives, etc.) when we rely on these ideas
2015-02-10 11:40:59	mzarella	...and it complicates simple ideas that we are already familiar with availabe in the language we love/hate
2015-02-10 11:43:04	@maxlynch_	mzarella: we are excited for it, though it's not a web environment and really that's where we want to see the future go. The overlap is smaller than I thought initially.

2015-02-10 13:08:55	mzarella	from a benchmark standpoint, i can agree
2015-02-10 13:08:59	christo_m	because angular is much more.. react is a smaller library that solves a specific problem

2015-02-10 13:14:12	breakingthings	you have to see where it settles after the hypemobile
2015-02-10 13:14:22	mzarella	two years ago was a completely different ball game
2015-02-10 13:14:25	mzarella	i was using mean then as well
2015-02-10 13:14:28	breakingthings	the react hypemobile is still a-rollin
2015-02-10 13:14:30	mzarella	i've moved past mean though
2015-02-10 13:15:34	mzarella	angular makes sense if you need to produce something quickly because you can have pretty much the same workflow on the web as the mobile
2015-02-10 13:15:53	mzarella	and usually "quickly" is all that matters in business
2015-02-10 13:16:03	pagios_	do you guys recommand c3.js to integrate with my hybria ionic app?

2015-02-10 13:17:20	mzarella	or 2013
2015-02-10 13:17:59	breakingthings	christo_m: the hype for react's announcement and early is still going on; search results and blog posts about it are still rolling off of the hype alone
2015-02-10 13:18:01	mzarella	it's like saying java applets is pro
2015-02-10 13:18:02	mzarella	it's dated
2015-02-10 13:18:11	pagios_	mzarella: c3 works?
2015-02-10 13:18:16	breakingthings	that is to say, judging it's current "popularity" is a bit flawed because people are still just talking about it because it's new
2015-02-10 13:18:34	breakingthings	not necessarily because of the real merit it may or may not have
2015-02-10 13:18:55	mzarella	aye
2015-02-10 13:19:18	mzarella	anyway, the only real reason to stick with angular _maybe_ is because you want to stick with web standards on the mobile side
2015-02-10 13:19:37	mzarella	i wish ember 2.0 was here and ionic was based on that :)
2015-02-10 13:20:22	christo_m	mzarella: whats dated about MEAN lol
2015-02-10 13:20:25	mzarella	but i am glad ionic exists as it turns out
2015-02-10 13:20:44	mzarella	mongo's hype was overblown

Take instagram for an example, their mobile app seems to be mirrored to their website but its formated so its the same width and doesnt stretch to fit
2015-02-10 16:43:48	@mhartington	qwebirc85293: use max-width on the card or the list the card is in 
2015-02-10 16:44:06	qwebirc85293	i don't want it to stretch the whole screen

2015-02-10 16:51:15	qwebirc85293	for example if the card on the mobile phone is 100% width, but on a website i would want it to emulate the same size (1 inch)

2015-03-17 14:00:19	breakingthings	maestrojed: It's possible to work with but if you're expecting them to work with the exact same requests as a standard client would then you would have some problems
2015-03-17 14:00:23	christo_m	something like that, with the ionicHistory service
2015-03-17 14:00:27	Marble68	Thanks christo_m: will investigate
2015-03-17 14:00:38	breakingthings	maestrojed: they likely return html which is not exactly practical to work with on the clientside
2015-03-17 14:00:42	christo_m	there might be a better way, thats a little old now
2015-03-17 14:01:02	breakingthings	maestrojed: Honestly without an API you're really in a pickle. You need an API of some sort to work with a mobile app.

2015-03-17 14:01:38	breakingthings	I'd really draw the line there and say either you get an API or you don't do it because it will only give you nightmares
2015-03-17 14:01:40	christo_m	the amount of work you'll do scraping things etc
2015-03-17 14:01:50	christo_m	eclipses writing an API
2015-03-17 14:01:58	christo_m	or having them invest in having one
2015-03-17 14:02:18	christo_m	breakingthings: have you ever done coachmarks in an ionic app by any chance?
2015-03-17 14:02:42	breakingthings	christo_m: no idea what that is and also I have been working on backend pieces for my ionic stuff so I don't actually have all that much experience with it yet
2015-03-17 14:02:43	maestrojed	breakingthings right, I figured it would be on my app to interpret the http response and determine if it was successful or not. Going to be a pain, I know. I don't expect it work like the exact same requests. But after a successful authentication I will need to make further http requests as an authenticated user. Its maintaining that user session I am worried about. Not async or parsing http responses.
2015-03-17 14:04:51	breakingthings	maestrojed: You're most likely going to have to roll your own management of the cookie; you'll have to pick apart the response headers to get the cookie information, and build it into your subsequent requests.
2015-03-17 14:05:04	maestrojed	christo_m there is no API and there will not be. Not every project is out of a text book. That is a parameter of the job. Sans that, its a great client and willing to pay for the madness. I find solutions. Its what I do and why I get hired.  Just trying to see if ionic can be a solution for me.
2015-03-17 14:05:07	breakingthings	Again, let me emphasize, this is a terrible idea :d
2015-03-17 14:05:19	maestrojed	breakingthings ok, good to know. Probably using local storage in the interim

2015-03-17 14:07:23	breakingthings	If shipping technical debt is a suitable solution in place of the actual solution because of arbitrary constraints, it sounds like you have a client nightmare :D
2015-03-17 14:07:51	ioudas^work	is it possible to setup a default object that is defaulted only once when the app starts using local storage. when the app is intalled? then i can push onto it say later?
2015-03-17 14:07:56	maestrojed	You only have limit knowledge of the project and politics. Those are big assumptions and kinda of offensive
2015-03-17 14:08:31	breakingthings	I might be making an ass outta me, but I would have to say I don't trust the premise whatsoever.
2015-03-17 14:08:47	breakingthings	It seems like there must be a naive reasoning to deny the best solution.

2015-03-20 14:17:48	ioudas	christo_m, got an odd question

2015-03-20 14:18:39	christo_m	ioudas: no im not getting in the bathtub with you
2015-03-20 14:18:47	christo_m	whatsup
2015-03-20 14:18:55	ioudas	You know you want to.
2015-03-20 14:19:06	ioudas	So know how we were talking about local storage

2015-03-20 14:19:45	christo_m	yes
2015-03-20 14:19:56	ioudas	you had an type of window.localstorage == undefined. That tests for the device HAS the ability? If that is the case. How do you initalize a sub set variable inside of it
2015-03-20 14:20:06	ioudas	like if you wanted to initalize it once for use.
2015-03-20 14:20:15	ioudas	i imagine you cant stick it in .ready/.run
2015-03-20 14:20:52	ioudas	so do you just always detect the variables existance at every run? or is there some other place.

2015-03-20 14:21:42	christo_m	i took out the check
2015-03-20 14:21:49	christo_m	i just do window.localStorage.firstRun = true, or whatever
2015-03-20 14:22:11	ioudas	gotcha. so you gotta detect if youve ever stored it.
2015-03-20 14:22:16	christo_m	thats right.
2015-03-20 14:22:17	ioudas	makes more sense now

2015-03-20 14:22:32	ioudas	was hoping for something like my.settings in .net
2015-03-20 14:22:50	christo_m	for example heres something i do in my settings controller: var mouseSpeed = (window.localStorage.mouseSpeed ? window.localStorage.mouseSpeed : '1');
2015-03-20 14:22:53	christo_m	just right up top.
2015-03-20 14:23:01	ioudas	ill give that a try. im not sure window.localstorage is best for arrays. but ill give it a try
2015-03-20 14:23:24	christo_m	depends how complicated you're doing things.
2015-03-20 14:23:31	christo_m	i just store simple app key value things.
2015-03-20 14:23:36	ioudas	im looking for an array of order numbers and their order date.
2015-03-20 14:23:41	ioudas	but id like them associated
2015-03-20 14:23:55	christo_m	i think you could alwasy hack it by saving a json string
2015-03-20 14:24:00	ioudas	as i might not know what order is going to be saved/queried. Orders can be deleted.
2015-03-20 14:24:01	christo_m	and then parsing out when reading it
2015-03-20 14:24:09	ioudas	yeah i saw some of that
2015-03-20 14:24:10	christo_m	probably make a service to deal with that.
2015-03-20 14:24:48	ioudas	hmm. ill give that a try. see if i could write a push function or something.
2015-03-20 14:24:58	ioudas	I only need to push orders if they are selected to be saved.
2015-03-20 14:25:23	christo_m	ioudas: or just use sqlite or something
2015-03-20 14:25:30	ioudas	have you messed with sqlite?
2015-03-20 14:25:32	christo_m	your use case maybe a bit too complicated for this
2015-03-20 14:25:34	christo_m	nah..
2015-03-20 14:25:42	ioudas	yeah havnt heard much on it
2015-03-20 14:25:42	christo_m	is it bad?
2015-03-20 14:25:56	ioudas	nah, not sure. i hear its more to setup.
2015-03-20 14:26:02	ioudas	havnt messed with cordova plugins...
2015-03-20 14:26:29	christo_m	hmm maybe you can get a document based thing like mongo setup haha
2015-03-20 14:26:31	christo_m	that'd be great.
2015-03-20 14:26:41	ioudas	well mongo db is web scale
2015-03-20 14:26:43	christo_m	i think most people just hook into API services
2015-03-20 14:26:55	christo_m	i know i just meant something like document store, not necessarily that much bloat
2015-03-20 14:27:00	ioudas	yeah, i was wondering if there was a better way.
2015-03-20 14:27:03	christo_m	because you're basically hacking your own document store with local storage
2015-03-20 14:27:04	christo_m	i think..
