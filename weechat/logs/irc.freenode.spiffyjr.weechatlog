2014-12-05 12:27:50	SpiffyJr	(Going through the post to verify all the changes)
2014-12-05 12:35:53	SpiffyJr	Heh, I think it's fixed.
2014-12-05 12:35:56	SpiffyJr	I just recompiled the css...
2014-12-05 12:36:13	SpiffyJr	Yep, it appears to be working now. My mistake :(
2014-12-05 12:37:41	mhartington	ahh alright, good to hear
2014-12-05 12:37:48	SpiffyJr	Surprised CSS was causing all that
2014-12-05 12:37:58	mhartington	css is a magic black box
2014-12-05 12:38:02	SpiffyJr	Indeed...
2014-12-05 12:38:05	mhartington	who knows what goes on 
2014-12-05 12:38:49	mhartington	so all good?
2014-12-05 12:38:56	SpiffyJr	Yep
2014-12-05 12:39:19	SpiffyJr	Well, other than the gigantic mess of this that I have to refactor ;)
