2014-10-07 12:52:19	TimothyKrell	As far as I'm aware, with relation to that specific $scope, it's the same. When refreshing the page, however, you are re initializing the entire angular app, not just that $scope and controller.

2014-10-07 12:54:58	ajr62	So do have any idea why switching tabs would cause a custom directive to “forget” its ability to data-bind?
2014-10-07 12:55:52	ajr62	The directive is definitely bound the first time a page loads, but after switching tabs, the directive isn’t bound to anything anymore, at least as far as I can tell.

2014-11-17 10:35:20	ioudas	yep arkin got it workin without the parent controller
2014-11-17 10:35:36	ioudas	i have been trying to make the object inherited from the first controller
2014-11-17 10:35:47	ioudas	instead of just defining it in the factory
2014-11-17 10:35:50	ioudas	that was my issue
2014-11-17 10:36:02	ioudas	thanks for helpin me find that ;-)
2014-11-17 10:36:04	arkin	np
2014-11-17 10:36:21	arkin	jpstone: according to the plugin docs, a location in the app that will be backed up to the cloud
2014-11-17 10:36:35	arkin	if you use native outside of the plugin, i think its wherever safari/etc stores it
2014-11-17 10:36:45	jpstone	arkin: which doc are you looking at?
2014-11-17 10:37:07	arkin	jpstone: https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin
2014-11-17 10:37:29	arkin	"Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known, can be reconfigured, and iOS will be backed up by iCloud."
2014-11-17 10:37:50	jpstone	right, just saw that
2014-11-17 10:38:06	jpstone	so the question is...if it's "known", who knows it? :D and how can it be reconfigured?
2014-11-17 10:38:11	jpstone	i'm probably just missing it in the docs
2014-11-17 10:38:14	ioudas	now i gotta use ionic loading and pass a controller to cancel the promise/loader ;-P
2014-11-17 10:38:20	ioudas	gotta wrap my head around that
2014-11-17 10:38:56	jpstone	I'd like to save it in my apps sandbox
2014-11-17 10:39:02	arkin	not sure
2014-11-17 10:39:12	arkin	ioudas: pass a controller, whut?
2014-11-17 10:40:47	jpstone	if I can't find the actual file, it makes me scared to trust it :D
2014-11-17 10:41:12	ioudas	well
2014-11-17 10:41:20	ioudas	ionic loading has a custom loading template
2014-11-17 10:41:30	ioudas	i gotta figure out how to call a controller on a click button
2014-11-17 10:41:32	ioudas	in that
2014-11-17 10:41:43	ioudas	and pass a promise to the loader to cancel that
2014-11-17 10:42:02	ioudas	but i wanna keep the default loading icon
2014-11-17 10:42:08	ioudas	havnt seen it much anywhere.....
2014-11-17 10:42:15	ioudas	in terms of how to accomplish that.

2014-11-17 13:00:00	qwebirc48791	another concern mike - how long do views stay cached?  Example : Load app on main page, open side menu, navigate to Contacts.  Pick something in list of contacts.  Navigate to contact detail page.  Go Back to Contacts List.  Open side menu.  Go to main page.  Open side menu.  Select "Contacts" again.  It's still cached
2014-11-17 13:00:30	qwebirc48791	Kiind of feel like once the history chain has been killed with nav-clear, the previously cached pages should be clobbered

2014-11-17 13:04:20	@mhartington	right, so views will be cached forever
2014-11-17 13:04:45	@mhartington	but on a view-per-view instance, AFAIK
2014-11-17 13:06:32	qwebirc48791	i think nav-clear should mean kill all caches, don't you?  it clears histroy - so it clearly means I'm not going back there.  If I do, it's probably been a while and i need a refresh
2014-11-17 13:07:59	qwebirc48791	worried about caching forever too - need some means to clear that stuff.  Like if someone gets back to the "main page", should be able to use a single command to bust all those caches.
2014-11-17 13:09:09	@mhartington	ahh, missed this one
2014-11-17 13:09:10	@mhartington	http://ionicframework.com/docs/nightly/api/service/$ionicHistory/
2014-11-17 13:09:30	@mhartington	so this is essentially ionic.viewService
2014-11-17 13:09:48	@mhartington	so you would do $ionicHistory.clearHistory();
2014-11-17 13:10:13	qwebirc48791	but it doesn't say what impact that has on cachees

2014-11-17 13:13:51	qwebirc48791	hey @adamdbradley !
2014-11-17 13:14:34	qwebirc48791	@adamdbradley & @mhartington - cool about the cache on the todo list.  Be nice if nav-clear or $ionicHistory.clearHistory() blew out all the caches
2014-11-17 13:14:46	@adamdbradley	yeah that's a good idea
2014-11-17 13:15:15	@adamdbradley	probably end up making a method that just clears out the cache, and also be able to do this: $ionicHistory.clearHistory({ clearCache: true })

2014-11-17 16:24:44	BahamutWC|Work	well the tabs have the ng-hide class on them, so they’re set to display: none
2014-11-17 16:25:03	BahamutWC|Work	I’m only seeing 10 rendered in the DOM though, clearly some JS is limiting how many get created
2014-11-17 16:25:37	@adamdbradley	so that's where I'm confused, trying to figure out why the same app, on the same phone, is so much slower on cordova then the web browser, especially if its android 4.4
2014-11-17 16:26:03	BahamutWC|Work	nvm, turns out it was malformed DOM…ugh

2014-11-17 17:08:39	Marble68	Q: Using UI-Router - suppose I have a list of contacts and when tapped, I wish to show details. I have successfully linked them, and via the controller I can output to console via console.log($stateParams.contactId). Where I’m sort of lost is where do I go from here? In my template, do I just simply reference the $scope.contacts? {{$scope.contacts[$stateParams.contactId].fullName}}  - like that?
2014-11-17 17:10:13	chalettu	i think you are close for the most part
2014-11-17 17:10:22	chalettu	i always leave off the $scope. part in my templates
2014-11-17 17:11:27	chalettu	i have a tendency though to take variables like that and create a scope level variables from them to help make sure my templates are easily readable
2014-11-17 17:11:37	chalettu	but thats just a personal preference
2014-11-17 17:12:53	Marble68	oh - wow - ok - that illuminates a bit - so the template is “in scope” of the controller - so if the controller knows the variable contactID, the template knows {{contactId}} ?
2014-11-17 17:14:13	Marble68	nope
2014-11-17 17:14:17	chalettu	not necesarily , someone can correct me if i am wrong
2014-11-17 17:14:17	Marble68	that’s not the case.. LOL
2014-11-17 17:14:38	chalettu	so with state params i usually assign them to a scope variable as well.
2014-11-17 17:14:47	Marble68	k
2014-11-17 17:14:48	chalettu	$scope.params=$stateParams
2014-11-17 17:14:54	Marble68	that makes sense
2014-11-17 17:15:01	chalettu	so then you can address params.contactId
2014-11-17 17:15:16	chalettu	but once again, i say that is just how i have done it
2014-11-17 17:15:26	chalettu	anyone can chime in on best practices
2014-11-17 17:15:44	Marble68	so I could have $scope.currentContact = $scope.contacts[$stateParams.contactIe]
2014-11-17 17:15:52	chalettu	yeah
2014-11-17 17:15:54	Marble68	then - {{could do currentContact.fullName}}
2014-11-17 17:16:02	chalettu	exactly
2014-11-17 17:16:06	Marble68	k - that helps me a lot
2014-11-17 17:16:07	Marble68	thank you
2014-11-17 17:16:17	chalettu	although you might want to fix your typo on variable name
2014-11-17 17:16:17	chalettu	hehe
2014-11-17 17:16:21	chalettu	contact.Id
2014-11-17 17:16:22	Marble68	I’m now - so it’s sort of the flow / best practice of handing info off and around is alien for me

2014-11-18 13:05:04	frankblizzar	so I am trying hard to improve performance on my (first) ionic app. it's like a time line with cards, each card has like a h1, an image and some text. infinite scroll, around 20 items each time. what I did already: use ionic nightly and angular 1.3 bind-once everywhere, disable animations, no filters in html.

2014-11-19 10:11:41	BahamutWC	mhartington: so I encountered a bug with the slide box in the latest master, not sure if it's known - the watcher doesn't seem to work for the active slide, even when switched to what appears to be the new selected attribute (as opposed to active-slide)

2014-11-19 10:12:42	@mhartington	any chance you could put together a codepen?

2014-11-19 10:13:39	BahamutWC	mhartington: oh, we have to use the slideBoxDelegate now?
2014-11-19 10:13:59	@mhartington	for getting the active slide?
2014-11-19 10:14:01	BahamutWC	well, even that codepen seems broken
2014-11-19 10:14:08	BahamutWC	clicking next doesn't do anything
2014-11-19 10:14:18	BahamutWC	or previous
2014-11-19 10:14:20	@mhartington	yeah the next/previous stuff is broken right now
2014-11-19 10:14:31	@mhartington	andrews working on it atm
2014-11-19 10:14:44	BahamutWC	alright cool - hoping it would be fixed sometime this week
2014-11-19 10:15:16	@mhartington	so what was the issue you saw?
2014-11-19 10:15:21	BahamutWC	made the mistake of upgrading it for using angular 1.3 since there were some pre-existing bugs I hoped were fixed by the refactor present in master, but I encountered some nasty new ones heh
2014-11-19 10:15:47	BahamutWC	just that I was using the active-slide attribute on the slide box, and so I created left-right arrows for toggling between slides
2014-11-19 10:15:57	BahamutWC	they stopped working when I upgraded though
2014-11-19 10:16:20	@mhartington	ah the next/previous functionality? 
2014-11-19 10:16:25	BahamutWC	yeah
2014-11-19 10:16:44	@mhartington	alright, thought it was something to do with getting the active slide
