2014-11-21 16:22:37	olimex	Hi!
2014-11-21 16:23:59	olimex	nils_2: FlashCode told me I could ping you (for some matters regarding Raspbian).
2014-11-21 16:24:50	olimex	(mps are welcome to not pollute the chan)
2014-11-21 16:25:20	Mikaela	you might want to say those matters as there are other people who might be able to help or have similar matters
2014-11-21 16:25:22	 *	Mikaela has Raspbian too, but her weechat isn't on it
2014-11-21 16:27:06	olimex	Mikaela: it was just a quick feedback (and some additional questions).
2014-11-21 16:27:11	@FlashCode	Mikaela: the question is about debian packages, which are built by nils_2, so I think he's the right person to help on that :)
2014-11-21 16:27:25	Mikaela	oh, I see. No one mentioned packages
2014-11-21 16:27:35	nils_2	olimex: go ahead. you can query me
2014-11-21 16:27:42	@FlashCode	he did, on the French weechat channel ;)
2014-11-21 16:28:08	Mikaela	I don't understand French even if I wish to
2014-11-21 16:28:10	Mikaela	oh and those packages are also unsigned so I am not using them
2014-11-21 16:28:13	olimex	Here's what's been going on on my side : I have an Olinuxino card (opensource hardware running Allwinner A20 dual core). So I added the Raspbian repo.
2014-11-21 16:28:26	olimex	Weechat runs nicely, no problem!
2014-11-21 16:29:19	olimex	Except for the scripts! I had a dependency problem, weechat-plugins required guile-2.0-libs.
2014-11-21 16:29:37	olimex	Except for the scripts! I had a dependency problem, weechat-plugins required guile-1.8-libs (in dev).
2014-11-21 16:30:02	olimex	So I had to upgrade to jessie, and could finally get weechat-plugins.
2014-11-21 16:31:41	olimex	I don't know how it is on the Raspbian side. It was a little puzzling to see that with both repos being under wheezy, there was this little hurdle (no biggie, granted! ;)).
2014-11-21 16:32:51	olimex	Also, just for information, with just how many ARM devices is this repo usable?
2014-11-21 16:34:38	nils_2	i don't know. i did not test with many arm devices :-)
2014-11-21 16:36:22	olimex	nils_2: ok :) I don't know if it would be worthwhile to add a small information, for those like me who use different ARM boards?
2014-11-21 16:37:01	olimex	Because it appears it would be better to upgrade to jessie from the start. XD
2014-11-21 16:37:46	olimex	(just saying)

2014-11-21 16:40:51	nils_2	and guile-2.0 is part of raspbian
2014-11-21 16:42:18	Mikaela	upgrading Raspbian to Jessie is difficult
2014-11-21 16:42:59	olimex	Mikaela: sarcasm?
2014-11-21 16:43:52	Mikaela	olimex: have you ever tried it?

2014-11-21 16:44:21	Mikaela	it wants to edit every possible config file and I thought I knew where to allow it and where to not and that system didn't boot anymore

2014-11-21 16:45:34	olimex	Mikaela: no, still under Wheezy with my Raspberry Pi. Thanks for the warning though!

2014-11-21 16:46:13	olimex	So I guess the Weechat repos have not been used by many people for ARM devices? XD
2014-11-21 16:46:37	nils_2	olimex: tested the raspbian package on cubietruck and its working fine :-)
2014-11-21 16:47:17	Mikaela	I might use them if they were signed
2014-11-21 16:48:10	olimex	Ok. Well, what I'm using is very close to the Cubieboard/Cubietruck. I guess it will remain a mystery. XD
2014-11-21 16:48:56	nils_2	now i am testing on my nas
